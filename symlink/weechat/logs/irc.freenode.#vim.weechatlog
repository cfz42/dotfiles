2016-05-12 08:39:20	PaulePanter	Hi. When starting Vim and then doing `:set tw` it says `textwidth=0`.
2016-05-12 08:39:41	PaulePanter	But when I do `gq` to rewrap a paragraph, it of course does not use 0.
2016-05-12 08:39:59	PaulePanter	How do I get the default value for the line length?

2016-05-12 19:49:16	ntnn	also comes in handy for other stuff like header guards and generally flow strucutres

2016-05-12 20:56:24	ntnn	another solution, would be a search with a macro. e.g. `/\d\d\d` and then on 002 `qq<c-a>nq` to record the macro in register q and hit 238@@ to repeat the macro 280 times
2016-05-12 20:56:53	ntnn	ye, that'd be my third suggestion, but that can be a pita

2016-05-12 23:30:16	vimgor	OSX comes with vim 7.3 with no patches or clipboard support. Install homebrew ( http://brew.sh ) and then brew install vim. This is updated weekly. Use brew install vim --HEAD to get the latest patches. For a good terminal emulator https://iterm2.com . For a graphical interface ask me about macvim. For tmux problems ask me about tmux-osx.

2016-05-13 05:45:00	vstemen	Hi.  I have been running vim for several years with backupdir set to ~/vim_backups in ~/.vimrc and it has been working fine.
2016-05-13 05:45:04	vstemen	However ever since I upgraded FreeBSD which upgraded to vim-lite-7.4.884, it writes backup files both in ~/vim_backups and in the working directory of each file I edit, leaving backup files all over my system.
2016-05-13 05:45:12	vstemen	Has there been a change in how backupdir is used or something?

2016-05-13 13:06:28	iron_houzi	unclechu_: Let me clarify my point .. any remapping that deviates from the standard will alianate you from *all* Vim setups .. of course this goes for a lot of the stuff in your vimrc, but please have this in the back of your mind when changing the defaults .. it should be for a *very* good reason .. and not because this is your current preference from your previous text editor.

2016-05-13 16:44:59	vimgor	vim-startify is a plugin from mhi^ that shows a fancy Vim start screen with recently used files, bookmarks and sessions. - https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify
2016-05-13 16:45:03	phy1729	ntnn: maybe ^ ?
2016-05-13 16:45:18	teatime	I am also a big fan of what compiz calls maximumize or maxmumize or something... and I've seen that feature creeping into other WMs, which is nice.  where you can hit a key or button to expand the size of a window up to wherever it butts up against another.
2016-05-13 16:46:06	teatime	no matter what GUI env I'm in, I always end up doing a kind of manualish, mostly-tiled thing

2016-05-14 00:53:29	Zestyr	At first no completions would pop up, and the server hadn't been built (after installing with Vim-Plug). I tried installing it manually and building the server (as instructed by the README), and that mostly worked. When opening a .cs file, an xterm window opens with the OmniSharp server log (output: http://vpaste.net/bSR5X - it fails to find System
2016-05-14 00:53:29	Zestyr	.XML). The biggest issue right now is that there is no completion for anything Unity related, although it was loaded according to the log.
2016-05-14 00:53:31	ntnn	vimgor: smartindent
2016-05-14 00:53:31	vimgor	Don't you mean stupidindent? In all seriousness, 'smartindent' is an obsolete option for C-like syntax. It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype plugin indent on' and be happy.

2016-05-14 07:42:01	raedah	i took it out of my .vimrc.  opened up vim, :color returns 'default'.  then i do :colorscheme gruvbox , the colorscheme doesnt visibily change at all. :color says 'gruvbox'
2016-05-14 07:42:23	raedah	im in gnome-terminal / tmux

2016-05-14 07:43:01	watabou	right, and that's the problem
2016-05-14 07:43:24	raedah	do i need to set 256 something in my bash_profile?
2016-05-14 07:43:35	watabou	If you Vim detects your terminal to be something like screen, or xterm, it'll assume that you're using an 8 color terminal.
2016-05-14 07:43:47	watabou	Not in your bash profile, no. In your ~/.tmux.conf
2016-05-14 07:44:15	watabou	raedah: gnome-terminal *should* already return xterm-2566color outside of tmux, yes?
2016-05-14 07:44:29	raedah	yes

2016-05-15 01:39:49	ntnn	i.e. syntastic is often used because people don't know how to code _or_ how to read compile output
2016-05-15 01:39:53	aricz	jesus ..
2016-05-15 01:39:59	aricz	it's to make coding faster.. wtf

2016-05-15 01:47:17	aricz	but that might've been done with vim-native..
2016-05-15 01:47:25	ntnn	because it gives you time to think about the function you're editing, since it takes easymotion so long to but you where you want to be?

2016-05-15 01:48:13	aricz	maybe I'm doing it wrong
2016-05-15 01:48:32	robertmeta	aricz: here is the issue -- vim has sort of an internal consistency thing -- and it is very hard for plugins to play properly with it.
2016-05-15 01:48:43	aricz	ok I see
2016-05-15 01:48:45	romainl	vanilla easymotion: /foo<CR>
2016-05-15 01:48:57	aricz	I thought perhaps syntastic would be something that should be built in
2016-05-15 01:49:08	aricz	why not.. but I hear you.. bloat
2016-05-15 01:49:10	aricz	so it's ok
2016-05-15 01:49:13	robertmeta	aricz: for example, "repeating" things is hard with plugins, hard enough repeat.vim had to be created and plugins have to opt in.
2016-05-15 01:49:25	romainl	syntastic is already built-in
2016-05-15 01:49:29	robertmeta	aricz: undotree, jumplist, etc are all things plugins have to take care to maintain, which is non-trivial.
2016-05-15 01:49:57	robertmeta	Now, some authors do (and we list plugins on the prior link that are generally good eggs)
2016-05-15 01:50:00	aricz	syntastic is already built in? then why is there a plugin for it?
2016-05-15 01:50:03	aricz	brb..
2016-05-15 01:50:39	romainl	because of ignorant people like you and millions of others who prefer to use plugins instead of learning vim
2016-05-15 01:50:41	robertmeta	aricz: **most** plugins duplicate existing functionality -- there isn't some magical button that stops someone from writing a plugin for something vim already does.

2016-05-15 01:51:21	robertmeta	the docs are great when you know what you are looking for and how to word it.

2016-05-15 01:51:47	romainl	always
2016-05-15 01:52:00	aricz	so I could get rid of syntatic..
2016-05-15 01:52:07	robertmeta	aricz: vim does A LOT out of the box, it just is often hard to find the bits
2016-05-15 01:52:19	aricz	yeah, of course, that's the name of the game when it comes to linux
2016-05-15 01:52:25	robertmeta	and, honestly, have the time the authors of plugins find the bits half-way through writing the plugin, and make it a thin wrapper
2016-05-15 01:52:26	romainl	hence the "learning" part
2016-05-15 01:52:27	aricz	but when you have people writing plugins.. to make it easier
2016-05-15 01:52:35	aricz	more easy..
2016-05-15 01:52:35	robertmeta	aricz: not easier.
2016-05-15 01:52:48	robertmeta	aricz: the truth is -- plugins are often a form of discoverability
2016-05-15 01:52:56	robertmeta	IE: vim docs don't come up on google search much
2016-05-15 01:52:58	robertmeta	plugins do.

2016-05-15 01:55:54	aricz	I'm a newbie to vi/vim
2016-05-15 01:55:55	robertmeta	They are often not required, and really just paperover some vim feature
2016-05-15 01:55:58	aricz	but figured out plugins helped me
2016-05-15 01:56:03	robertmeta	learn vim native way of doing stuff first.
2016-05-15 01:56:03	aricz	hm ok
2016-05-15 01:56:04	romainl	and in your case even with the basic <C-n>
2016-05-15 01:56:09	robertmeta	plugins are a last resort.
2016-05-15 01:56:15	ntnn	they just need to not duplicate existing functionality or work against how vim is meant to be used - because vim really isn't an editor you can make whatever you want
2016-05-15 01:56:20	robertmeta	again, we love plugins in #vim -- we use (and often write) them
2016-05-15 01:56:34	robertmeta	vim isn't emacs.

2016-05-15 01:57:06	ntnn	netrw, more or less
2016-05-15 01:57:22	robertmeta	and, it was more --- hehe -- insistence?
2016-05-15 01:57:26	ntnn	hehe
2016-05-15 01:57:28	robertmeta	persistent pressure.
2016-05-15 01:57:44	romainl	nagging and bullying, even

2016-05-15 07:20:59	gabord	Hi, how do I check in the vimrc file, whether vim is running on a terminal which support utf8 characters or not?
2016-05-15 07:21:22	gabord	In the tty terminal, I cant really use all the utf8 characters, only in a gui terminal, like in xterm.
2016-05-15 07:22:09	robertmeta	gabord: I not sure vim can detect that

2016-05-15 07:22:21	gabord	That would be enough.
2016-05-15 07:22:23	staticshock	how does vim determine that stdin should get colorized as, say, a diff?
2016-05-15 07:22:44	staticshock	[a buffer originating from stdin, i mean]

2016-05-15 08:57:15	lopid	eg., markdown should be .md or whatever, rather than .txt
2016-05-15 08:57:28	teatime	ok?
2016-05-15 08:57:45	teatime	so then the "foo.txt.mkdn" style works for you.  :)
2016-05-15 08:58:11	lopid	did you mean you don't like just .md or the fact that there is any markdown type extension used?
2016-05-15 08:58:21	teatime	I don't like .md specifically
2016-05-15 08:58:24	lopid	ah
2016-05-15 08:58:30	teatime	I would use .markdown but it's kindof long

2016-05-15 09:02:59	teatime	although you're right, you could tell the build tool to assume that all .mkdn files should also get .txt processing afterward, and that is already a feature I plan to support
2016-05-15 09:03:20	teatime	but there are cases where you cannot make such an assumption w/o the user specifying for you
2016-05-15 09:03:31	teatime	and naturally, I now forget what that case would be.

2016-05-15 09:04:16	teatime	lopid: file isn't very trustworthy for telling apart different kinds of files that are also valid plain-text files.
2016-05-15 09:04:45	teatime	and explicit is better than implicit, and specifying is better than guessing, in general :)

2016-05-15 09:08:45	teatime	there's a different / opposite way a build tool could use the same form of extensions, too:  "foo.html.mkdn" could indicate that the build tool should parse the file as mkdn, and produce output as html (and it'd probably also strip the .mkdn extension from the filename to form the destination file name)
2016-05-15 09:09:07	teatime	but I'm certain when I was thinking about this last, it was the previous thing, and not that thing, that I wanted it for ...

2016-05-15 14:34:00	teatime	Hi.
2016-05-15 14:34:16	rdslw	After trying for 20 minutes, I surrender. How can I inside of xterm disable cursor in normal mode? My objective is to NOT see character under cursor, when cursor is on it. Anyone?
2016-05-15 14:34:18	teatime	1 sec, and I will ask my question.

2016-05-15 14:35:07	teatime	rdslw: can you explain in different dterms?
2016-05-15 14:35:09	rdslw	I tried using :hi ctermfg=black ctermbg=black   but to no avail

2016-05-15 14:35:20	rdslw	I'm in normal mode
2016-05-15 14:35:47	rdslw	when I navigate right/left on a line of text, cursor is is shown as a highlited block - just for me to know where I am

2016-05-15 18:25:29	GooseberryPie	Hi, I'm having some trouble understanding the %P prefix of the errorformat.  Once I push a file onto the stack I am still able to match files using %f for single-line messages.  But %f always becomes the file I pushed for multi-line messages.  What I want is this: if no file is matched, use the most recent file that was pushed to the stack (for both single- and multi-line messages).
2016-05-15 18:26:41	GooseberryPie	Also, why does %P require files to exist before they are pushed onto the stack?
2016-05-15 18:26:49	lopid	anamok: something like: ｢nnoremap gz let myscrolloff=&scrolloff | set scrolloff=999 …｣, required a bit more but you get my drift
2016-05-15 18:27:02	anamok	phy1729, I don't want to modify the text. Just scrolling. If you have a cursorline, it remains in the same line and the text "below" goes up/down.
2016-05-15 18:27:50	anamok	lopid: OK, will try
2016-05-15 18:27:56	phy1729	oh theres zt zz zb but I think theres also by one line

So for example if you are using xfce4-terminal and record there your registers, and then you start using terminator would you have to also record that stuff in the other one?

2016-05-21 12:46:49	awal	hi. when I am in visual selection mode, I can type I (shift+i because caps) to get to insert mode, type something, hit esc and what I typed is inserted on all the lines at the position which was visually selected. But if I hit the Insert key while in insert mode to switch to Replace mode, the same magic doesn't happen. It inserts the text only at that line. How to overcome this?
2016-05-21 12:47:46	awal	To avoid X/Y, the goal is: I want to replace whatever is visually selected with what I type, instead of inserting at position.
