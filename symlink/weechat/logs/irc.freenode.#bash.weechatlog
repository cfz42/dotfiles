2016-04-11 00:53:25	physikoi	hello #bash. I have a command that outputs images. Is it possible to pass *references* to the output to another command?
2016-04-11 00:54:13	JordiGH	Well, that's for arrays.
2016-04-11 00:54:17	JordiGH	What about for strings?
2016-04-11 00:54:18	geirha	if it's GNU find, then   find . -type d -empty -delete   should work

2016-04-11 00:57:26	Riviera	Right, hence a temp var, no?
2016-04-11 00:57:28	geirha	no, you have to recreate the whole string, which means you don't need the tmp var after all. Sorry
2016-04-11 00:58:26	JordiGH	Like... {start...}{flip1:...}{middle:...}{flip2:...}{end:....} where the ... are values that could possibly result in empty strings?
