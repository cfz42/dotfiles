2016-04-26 22:49:16	leehambley	hi all - I wonder if someone can confirm something for me? "Refs don't have their own datetime" -- I'm trying to get the time a *ref* created with `upadte-ref ...` (e.g it's specifically not a tag) if I run something like `git log -1 --format=%ai refs/myrefs/foo` does that print the time of what "foo" points to (it must, as far as I understand) as the `.git/refs/myrefs/foo` contains nothing but a treeish sha1

2016-04-26 22:51:09	Seveas	leehambley: if you have enabled the reflog for that ref or all refs, it will have that information
2016-04-26 22:51:15	@ojacobson	there is no meaningful record -at all- of the ref creation date -- loose refs have a ctime and mtime in the filesystem, but they're not guaranteed to have meaningful values, and they go away when the ref gets transported or packed
2016-04-26 22:51:47	leehambley	alright, thanks for that confirmation. does that hold true for annotatied tags too ?

2016-04-26 22:52:43	leehambley	or is the annotation of tags a special case ?

2016-04-27 00:19:37	Eugene	stash actually creates a new commit(and a special ref to keep it for you), then `stash pop` re-applies the changes from that commit to your working tree. checkout(in this manner) just tries to switch branches. If the starting-point for the new branch is not the same thing as your current HEAD it will try to checkout whatever it is you've asked, but abort if that would lose anything uncommited
2016-04-27 00:19:41	Eugene	Does that answer your question?

After cleaning up conflicts, and getting the merge commit in place, I'm noticing that my branch is 222 commits ahead of my origin/feature branch.  Is this normal?  Should I be doing a rebase instead?

2016-05-12 08:23:43	pierre365	hi. I'm new to git so bear with me please. I work in a team, and use git locally to track my change. There is a production ready software (where i do my commit), i putted that in a branch. when i develop a new functionality i create a new branch and merge it after with the master branch. my problem is, i've done a branch which i use for "development", which some functionalities that i don't care deactivated
2016-05-12 08:23:49	pierre365	. So when i make a new branch to develop a new functionality, i would first like to make a branch out of my development branch, complete it, then take the n latest change of that development branch and apply it to my master branch. is it possible please?

It can do this to commits: change the order, squash some of them together, remove some, add random existing commits from other branches, split them, and more... it's very powerful. Documentation is in the section "Interactive Rebase" in 'man git-rebase'.

Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2016-05-12 15:05:20	trudko	hi eveyone , I've got a tip to use ~/.gitconfig to setup filters like this http://pastie.org/10834262 but someone told me that this is bit abuse of filters. I am not quite sure why though , I think I am not really use about what should filter be used for

2016-05-12 15:06:55	trudko	For example one problem with this setup , which I dont understand is that when I do git stash there is one left over files with new lines added and git checkout ..path/to/file.foo doesnt revert the changes
2016-05-12 15:07:16	puff	I.e. I made some changes to a particular file on a feature branch, but then that feature was shelved, but now they want to unshelve it, and I'm trying to figure out which feature branch that was :-)

2016-05-12 15:07:24	glauxosdever	Hi, I have a hook at a publicly available http address. When I push to that, it executes git-update-server info and stores the received data in the real repository. Does git-update-server also activate the post-receive hook in the real repository?

2016-05-12 15:08:29	glauxosdever	Sorry, that's git update-server-info
2016-05-12 15:08:39	jast	trudko: filters influence how files are transformed when reading them from the index (smudge) or writing them to the index (clean). since this affects more operations than just checking out and 'git add'ing, it can have surprising side effects if (a) you don't use a pair of filters and (b) you use them for something a bit different from the general intention of 'normalizing' the files
2016-05-12 15:09:39	glauxosdever	Hi, I have a hook at a publicly available http address. When I push to that, it executes git update-server-info and stores the received data in the real repository. Does git update-server-info also activate the post-receive hook in the real repository?
2016-05-12 15:09:39	trudko	jast:  i see is the way I was told to use them proper, some people thought that commit hooks by be better place
2016-05-12 15:10:32	jast	glauxosdever: I don't quite understand how that "http address" relates to the "real repository"
2016-05-12 15:11:20	glauxosdever	I have a hook at http://glaux-os.org/repositories/glaux.git, which just passes the data to the real repository that's not at a valid http address.

2016-05-12 15:19:12	jast	glauxosdever: is the HTTP repo delivered using smart HTTP (the CGI backend)? if it's not, no hooks will ever be executed in it, so there's no way to trigger *anything*

2016-05-12 15:20:37	jast	in fact if you use smart HTTP you don't need to make the individual files available via HTTP anymore and so you won't need two repos in the first place
2016-05-12 15:20:53	glauxosdever	Ok, I push to that repo using ssh, but it's also accessible at http. When I push using ssh, the data is passed to the real repo.
2016-05-12 15:21:04	jast	oh, I see
2016-05-12 15:21:06	glauxosdever	(http - readonly)
2016-05-12 15:21:21	jast	does your hook that pushes to the real repo use 'git push' to do that? if so, the target's hooks will be run
2016-05-12 15:21:51	glauxosdever	It uses git update-server-info
2016-05-12 15:22:02	jast	okay, but that doesn't transfer any data anywhere else
2016-05-12 15:22:13	glauxosdever	Ok, I'll be later.
2016-05-12 15:22:14	jast	it just updates a list of refs that is used by the dumb HTTP mechanism

2016-05-12 18:24:31	bnb	Hello. Question: I've got a folder (`build/`) in my .gitignore file in two branches (`master` and `pages`). When I run my build script in master, it creates all the files I need in the `build/` directory (ignored by .gitignore). Why do 70% of those files (the same ones every time) go away when I switch to the `pages` branch?
2016-05-12 18:24:48	bnb	It appears that the build/assets/ folder is being pushed to my branches.
2016-05-12 18:25:11	bnb	I have in my gitignore `build/` and `build/**`
2016-05-12 18:25:26	Eugene	bnb - !ignore_tracked
2016-05-12 18:25:26	@gitinfo	bnb: Git only applies ignore patterns to untracked files. You can't use ignore patterns to ignore changes to files that are already tracked by git. To remove files only from git, but keeping them on disk, use git rm --cached <file>. Still, see https://gist.github.com/1423106 for ways people have worked around the problem.

2016-05-12 20:32:04	@gitinfo	That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?

2016-05-12 20:35:48	@gitinfo	virtouni: Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2016-05-12 20:38:53	tobiasvl	then it is fine, yes. rewriting all past commits to change the committer name and email will probably involve filter-branch. man git filter-branch
2016-05-12 20:38:53	@gitinfo	the git-filter-branch manpage is available at http://jk.gs/git-filter-branch.html
2016-05-12 20:39:19	+virtouni	Ah, thank you. It'll be useful for future reference.
2016-05-12 20:39:46	tobiasvl	for rewriting a single commit (which I sometimes have to do when making my first commit in a newly cloned repo and realizing I forgot to set my work email, for example), git commit --amend or !interactive_rebase are other ways to rewrite the past.
2016-05-12 20:39:46	@gitinfo	Interactive rebase sounds similar to rebase but has completely different abilities. It can do this to commits: change the order, squash some of them together, remove some, add random existing commits from other branches, split them, and more... it's very powerful. Documentation is in the section "Interactive Rebase" in 'man git-rebase'.

2016-05-13 02:47:17	@gitinfo	xreal: If you have made a change in your working directory and have NOT YET COMMITTED, you may "float" that change over to another (`git checkout oldbranch`) or new (`git checkout -b newbranch`) branch and commit it there.  If the files you changed differ between branches, the checkout will fail.  In that case, `git stash` then checkout, and `git stash apply` and go through normal conflict resolution.

2016-05-13 03:26:10	ojacobson	Are you sure that's a problem with git, and not with your web frontend?
2016-05-13 03:26:27	ojacobson	For example, if you clone the repo back after pushing, do the affected files look okay in the new clone?
2016-05-13 03:26:58	midacts	ill try that

2016-05-13 14:57:14	stickyboy	I've got an issue I want to understand with git rebase. I'm rebasing a branch on top of a new upstream branch and I'm seeing changed that don't make sense when I do the conflict resolution.
2016-05-13 14:57:27	+jast	boil milk, add rice, reduce temperature to simmer, let it swell for an hour or two, add more milk if it seems like it's going dry
2016-05-13 14:57:41	+qsx	in case some people haven’t noticed, bitkeeper (the VCS linux used to use and afhter which git was modeled) is open source now

2016-05-13 14:58:44	stickyboy	I use git most days, and rebase often.

2016-05-13 14:59:17	stickyboy	jast: Cool
2016-05-13 14:59:19	+jast	the best way to get tripped up if is one of the commits being rebased is a merge commit
2016-05-13 14:59:30	+qsx	as good as git may be, i don’t like the monoculture it’s becoming
2016-05-13 14:59:30	+jast	*is if
2016-05-13 14:59:31	+jast	dangit
2016-05-13 14:59:34	stickyboy	Lemme set up a clean new branch to start the rebase so I can explain.
2016-05-13 14:59:39	+qsx	cpython switched to git from mercurial …
2016-05-13 14:59:53	+jast	okay, but I can't stick around to listen, so good luck figuring this out with someone else :)

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2016-05-13 23:55:05	preaction	nobso: so create your new branch from master, then use filter-branch to remove what you don't want
2016-05-13 23:55:14	preaction	nobso: but do it somewhere safe, take a !backup
2016-05-13 23:55:14	@gitinfo	nobso: Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup.

2016-05-14 00:13:41	preaction	or, you could make multiple commits on master, and only one jekyll deploy. so gh-pages history isn't even a record of what's happening on master at all

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2016-05-14 02:47:05	JZA	I want to just ignore the changes, and rewrite everything else.
2016-05-14 02:47:17	JZA	is a configuration file which I dont really care if its overritten or ignore
2016-05-14 02:47:22	ojacobson	then destroy the changes
2016-05-14 02:47:29	JZA	how?
2016-05-14 02:47:31	ojacobson	git won't do it for you, but it does provide some tools to let you do so
2016-05-14 02:47:44	JZA	I think I can 'stash' changes
2016-05-14 02:47:54	ojacobson	`git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file` will stage the last committed version of the file, and overwrite the work tree. The changes will be gone, forever.
2016-05-14 02:48:04	ojacobson	If you want to keep the changes, then consider committing them (maybe on a branch), instead.
2016-05-14 02:48:21	JZA	yea dont really care is a config file, which I already move to my dot folder.
2016-05-14 02:48:44	JZA	so HEAD -- file.config

2016-05-14 03:00:00	Earnestly	I'm having a bit of trouble understanding git describe, tags, annotated tags and racket's github repo.  The repo clearly has tags all the way up to v6.5 as divined with `git tag`, however git describe (and git describe --tags (include "lightweight" tags?)) still refers to a v5.0.1.  Why is this the case and how can I convince git describe to use the latest tag?

2016-05-14 03:03:52	ojacobson	A lightweight tag is a name (refs/tags/something) that points directly to a commit. An annotated tag is a name (refs/tags/something, again) that points to a tag object.

2016-05-14 03:04:19	ojacobson	Annotated tags can carry metadata about the commit -- a tag message, a GPG signaure, and the identity of the tagger, along with some other details.
2016-05-14 03:04:23	ojacobson	So that's the --tags thing.
2016-05-14 03:04:25	-->	SimonNaa (~simon@p4FF1A0E1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #git
2016-05-14 03:04:36	Earnestly	ojacobson: I've read about this difference (annotated and lightweight) as well, and some people suggested --tags should include these lightweight tags in git describe
2016-05-14 03:04:38	ojacobson	The _other_ thing that's going on is that `git describe` describes a specific commit - by default, HEAD (the current commit)
2016-05-14 03:04:41	Earnestly	hm
2016-05-14 03:04:56	ojacobson	if the first tag reachable from the described commit is v5.0.1, then that's what git-describe will report.
2016-05-14 03:05:10	ojacobson	Even if newer tags exist, if they're not reachable, they're not relevant.
2016-05-14 03:05:23	Earnestly	Because v6.5 points directly to a commit, it's considered lightweight?
2016-05-14 03:05:40	ojacobson	Yes, that'd be a lightweight tag.
2016-05-14 03:06:04	Earnestly	ojacobson: This to me implies that racket should probably be doing something else if these are versioned releases tags
2016-05-14 03:06:20	ojacobson	Not necessarily. THere's nothing _wrong_ with lightweight tags.
2016-05-14 03:06:35	ojacobson	They store less information, but if nothing's using the extra information that goes into an annotated tag, that's just fine.
2016-05-14 03:06:38	ojacobson	It's a policy choice. :)
2016-05-14 03:06:41	Earnestly	no sure, but it is a problem when tools like git describe won't reference them
2016-05-14 03:06:46	ojacobson	git-describe happens to default to a different policy.
2016-05-14 03:07:02	ojacobson	A lot of git(1) tools default to more-or-less what the linux kernel team do, or the git team do
2016-05-14 03:07:11	Earnestly	right, and aligning with git describe seems to be better for everyone involved
2016-05-14 03:07:27	Earnestly	Unless there's downsides to this that I'm unaware of
2016-05-14 03:07:31	ojacobson	Maybe so. You should suggest it to the Racket team.
2016-05-14 03:07:36	Earnestly	(less information is so-so)

2016-05-14 03:08:10	Earnestly	ojacobson: It's still rather curious that git describe has no way to include these lightweight tags, hm
2016-05-14 03:08:20	ojacobson	It does. That's what --tags does.
2016-05-14 03:08:46	Earnestly	ojacobson: But that's where I'm confused then, because I still get the same result: https://ptpb.pw/5qKB
2016-05-14 03:09:09	ojacobson	That newer tags exist does not imply that newer tags are an ancestor of HEAD (the commit you're describing)
2016-05-14 03:09:20	Earnestly	Oh boy
2016-05-14 03:09:21	ojacobson	that any newer tag is an ancestor, sorry
2016-05-14 03:09:46	ojacobson	Without looking at the commit graph of the racket repo, that's the most likely explanation.
2016-05-14 03:10:02	ojacobson	you can check, though: pick a newer tag, let's say v6.5
2016-05-14 03:10:27	ojacobson	if both `git rev-list --count HEAD..v6.5` and `git rev-list --count v6.5..HEAD` are non-zero, then v6.5 is not an ancestor of HEAD

2016-05-14 16:55:19	maxb	Regarding something else in your paste - "HEAD" is just the name of a pointer which points to a branch. The pointed-to branch is considered the default branch within the repository
2016-05-14 16:56:22	+Buk	So: git init/add/commit the original. copy over the modified and git add ./commit the modifications. But then how do you undo individual changes in the source tree?
2016-05-14 16:57:04	maxb	osse's suggestion (which I agree with) is to not commit all the modifications at once.

2016-05-14 16:58:28	+Buk	maxb: Hm. So that means I need to selectively overlay bits of the modified version: commit; overlay some more: commit ....?
2016-05-14 16:59:18	maxb	It's an option - otherwise, git has some interesting tools (which I admittedly haven't ever really used myself) for committing just parts of modifications to files in the working directory
2016-05-14 16:59:20	+osse	Buk: Much simpler! Use git add on individual files or directories. Use git add -p to selectively add individual changes

Subtract one from the other, and you have a list of whitespace only files so you can ''git add'' immediately

2016-05-14 22:07:47	kus	hi, I am a noob and I'd like to copy everything from ~/my_work folder to /var/www/html but I don't want to copy the .git folder. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04. How do?
2016-05-14 22:08:49	+Buk	fakenullie: I man I want to records a batch of changes such that they can be undone (reverted?) individually. I thought, and your statement seems to confirm, that that means I need a separate commit for every change?

2016-05-14 22:09:02	kus	my terminal fu and my google fu is failing me. cp -a ~/my_work/ /var/www/html/ simply creates the folder inside html

2016-05-15 06:02:59	blaenk	sorry wasn't looking at the conversation tobyn_, thanks, thanks phroa
2016-05-15 06:03:31	blaenk	basically I have a program that generates some things and I want it to base it on the HEAD, even if the user has changes. I was thinking perhaps I could stash things but I don't want to pull the rug from under them

2016-05-15 06:04:20	blaenk	first I was going to just create a new directory and setup a local remote pointing to the original repo and pull from it, but that ends up keeping two copies of everything when I really just need a copy of one of the directories

2016-05-15 06:05:10	blaenk	phroa: not sure about git clone, that would require the directory to be a repo
2016-05-15 06:05:27	blaenk	so basically I have repo/, and repo/input/ is a directory I need to feed to my program for it to generate my output files
2016-05-15 06:05:42	+phroa	you can clone with a --depth=1 so you don't pull the entire history, or you can use a little plumbing and scripting to get a list of object hashes present at HEAD, then cat-file them out to a new folder
2016-05-15 06:05:43	blaenk	but the user may have working tree changes, so I need to ensure I get repo/input/ from HEAD

2016-05-15 07:46:01	topi`	is there any drawbacks in cherry-picking commits from one branch to another? Say, I've got the "cleanup" code branch, and then a "devel" branch, and want to land the same fix in both

2016-05-15 07:46:35	topi`	a git merge or rebase would basically do the same thing
2016-05-15 07:48:05	fakenullie	if you made your fix on devel branch, you usually have to cherry pick, pecause you don't want all devel commits on stable branch
2016-05-15 07:48:18	fakenullie	but if you made your fix on stable branch, you can merge it back to devel
2016-05-15 07:48:29	topi`	I've artificially kept the "cleanup" branch up-to-date by continually rebasing it
2016-05-15 07:48:52	fakenullie	I don't know how this is branch is different from devel then

2016-05-15 07:51:43	fakenullie	it could make sense to merge then
2016-05-15 07:52:32	fakenullie	but why your changes from cleanup do not end up in devel?
2016-05-15 07:53:30	topi`	I was just wondering if I can just use git cherry-pick instead of a merge
2016-05-15 07:54:04	fakenullie	you can
2016-05-15 07:54:14	fakenullie	why not
2016-05-15 07:54:24	+phroa	topi`: you could take a page out of git-flow's book and spawn an individual hotfix/blahblah branch off of master for each fix, then merge it into both devel and master
2016-05-15 07:55:05	+phroa	the drawback of cherry-pick would be commit duplication in the history if you ever merge devel and master
2016-05-15 07:55:14	+phroa	(well, and commit duplication in general.)

2016-05-15 15:30:06	@gitinfo	Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup.

2016-05-15 15:30:35	+outsider	thank you for help guys
2016-05-15 15:30:54	razieliyo	I made a branch B from master, then pushed a few commits to master and now I want to get master back as the branch B was; tried via git merge B (from master) but it tells me it's up to date; does anyone know a way to handle this?
2016-05-15 15:31:05	razieliyo	basically the master is 3 commits ahead of B
2016-05-15 15:32:43	satifant	what do you want to happen with those 3 commits?
2016-05-15 15:33:12	razieliyo	satifant, I have made another branch from master to preserve those changes, but I would like to keep master as it was without those 3 commits

2016-05-15 15:44:07	@gitinfo	Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2016-05-16 01:46:45	@gitinfo	Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2016-05-16 12:14:53	spykins	is this an alternative to merging?
2016-05-16 12:15:21	TomyLobo	so you're discarding the removal of the LICENSE and readme etc

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2016-05-16 15:45:37	kgirthofer	I realize I can google it, but I'm looking for direct feedback and people who've done it in their environments
2016-05-16 15:45:49	@qsx	the !best way would be !svn2git
2016-05-16 15:45:49	@gitinfo	[!bestway] You want to know the best way to do X? If you can give us a proper definition of "best", we'll give you a proper way to do X ;)
2016-05-16 15:45:49	@gitinfo	For a one-time conversion of SVN to git, svn2git should be used instead of git-svn. There are many tools with this name. Probably the best is the KDE one at https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git. To analyze the SVN repo history upfront for building up proper rules for svn2git, you might use svneverever from here: http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=763
2016-05-16 15:46:08	@qsx	it’ll require _some_ handwork, but either that or you get an ugly result
2016-05-16 15:46:11	themill	svn-all-fast-export can sometimes work but can also get badly confused by newer svn features

2016-05-16 17:25:27	Stevko	Hello. I have two clones of a repo. If I run „git checkout -q HASH  && git log --oneline -- foo.xml | wc -l“ I get different results in each (1 or 16). Can that be correct? If I do blame on the file, I get completely different results where one of them shows every line from one commit which has ^ at the beginning (which should mean boundary commit – I am not certain what that means).
2016-05-16 17:26:00	grawity	is one of them a shallow clone?
2016-05-16 17:26:24	Stevko	I do not think so. How can I check?

2016-05-19 01:16:34	chardan	Hi! I have a git question and hope this is the place to ask! I have a project I've cloned on github along with its submodules. I have a fork of one of those submodules, and I want to clone my submodule into this. When I do "git submodule add https://blah/foo.git" I get a message saying that "foo/project" already exists in the index. What's the right way to do this?

2016-05-19 01:22:03	chardan	sbeller_: I'm still missing a step, I think. "submodule update" is saying that the pathspec doesn't match any files known to git, but if I use "submodule add" it still tells me that the submodule already exists in the index.
