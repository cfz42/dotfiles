2016-05-12 16:08:53	tpe	diegoviola, the difference back then was that Microsoft had no real competition in the PC gaming space.

Simple: I happen to own perfeclty fine hardware that isn't supported under windows by their manufacturers anymore. It means no windows drivers available. Works fine under most linux-based distributions though. Why toss out perfectly working hardware?

2016-05-12 21:34:00	jimmy51v_	maybe something similar here?
2016-05-12 21:34:37	Penguin	jimmy51v_: * would be files that don't start with a dot.  If you have a directory with only dotfiles in it, cp somedir/* otherdir will give the cannot stat error, since no files match the glob.
2016-05-12 21:34:56	Penguin	But if you have only dotfiles, you can cp somedir/. otherdir and it will copy your dotfiles.

2016-05-12 21:54:40	Iridos	anyway, I don't think you need to go all bonkers about not paste-binning excerpts... #debian itself had a pretty strict stance against it... but people published full channel-logs anyway and at some point they just put the url of the channel logs as a warning in the /topic

2016-05-13 04:38:50	Karlton	err, all binaries have static functions I mean
2016-05-13 04:39:34	esselfe	zrts: the only strategy I've seen using static libs was dash in Ubuntu (that is when I used it in 2006) and the idea was to have a working shell if something was wrong with other libs. I've heard some poeple on this channel say they used only statically linked programs... I don't know, personally I don't why it would be really a bad idea although it does seem useless

2016-05-13 17:03:48	jml2	triceratux, a distro is as good as how united that community is.  if developers don't care about a user base or care about connecting to their users, nobody will give feedback..  on the long run debian eventually went from a  sour shitty installer, to one that became graphical and much easier to deal with -- it wasn't until ~ debian 6 that its installer was way better not just graphically but in other aspects as well
2016-05-13 17:03:49	triceratux	jml2: but it also means ive got no exposure to installtime fde or lvm or anaconda or any of those wonders. i just boot & shoot :)

2016-05-14 02:38:26	pingfloyd	kadiro: because of 3D APIs and GPUs they don't need to use ASM much anymore.

2016-05-14 03:43:14	pingfloyd	jaymaker: then the assumption is that is supported by steamos.  So I would file a bug report.

2016-05-14 03:43:53	jaymaker	So the problem is on their end, not mine. Well, that's nice
2016-05-14 03:43:59	pingfloyd	jaymaker: the implication is that steamos provides additional packages with using those as a basis.
2016-05-14 03:44:00	Queenslayer	I think I might have fixed it though
2016-05-14 03:44:08	jim	ok, then, you would just write the image to the whole usb (like, /dev/sdc, -not- /dev/sdc1) and use a plain writer, NOT unetbootin, it doesn't work with debian or ubuntu netinstalls or live cds
2016-05-14 03:44:09	jml2	triceratux, not any more.. well with fixing grub at least-- the community now has access to boot-repair iso-- 1-click and uefi or bios gets fixed..
2016-05-14 03:44:11	pingfloyd	jaymaker: yeah, it's got to be on their end if you didn't change anything yourself
2016-05-14 03:44:12	ZeZu	boot into windows,  use 7zip or winrar to extract ISO onto FAT32 formatted USB

2016-05-14 03:44:43	pingfloyd	jaymaker: the idea is if they have you use those repos, it is supposed to work with them
2016-05-14 03:44:49	Queenslayer	ZeZu, initramfs
2016-05-14 03:44:58	jim	ZeZu, you just dd the image to the usb then boot
2016-05-14 03:45:08	ZeZu	jim,  sometimes that doesn't work
2016-05-14 03:45:09	pingfloyd	jaymaker: so somewhere there is a conflict and the steamos maintainers let a conflict slip through the cracks
2016-05-14 03:45:18	Queenslayer	I think the UEFI firmware is not being able to find the partition on the USB
2016-05-14 03:45:28	jml2	ZeZu, for the main distros win32image(dd) always works

2016-05-14 12:42:04	EriC^^	wait a minute and then bg it
2016-05-14 12:42:13	gajus	EriC^^ what?
2016-05-14 12:42:13	frostschutz	it's stopped (frozen). what happens when you wake it depends on the program, sleep might notice that 40 seconds passed or it might not
2016-05-14 12:42:16	wodny	it's about interrupting syscalls with a  signal
2016-05-14 12:42:29	EriC^^	and it'll finish
2016-05-14 12:43:07	gajus	Okay. Turns out that ctrl-z indeed stops program. Then back to the original question. I have started a program using `sleep 1000` How to I send it to background?
2016-05-14 12:43:07	EriC^^	it'll stay in ps aux until you bg it again, then it'll just stop like it had continued the whole time

2016-05-14 13:23:19	tuxayo	wodny, I log with ssh but I guess it shouldn't matter as the objective is to have the service launched on boot without any to login.

2016-05-14 17:54:48	nutzz	hexnewbie, it works with '\n', but I was just wondering what happens behind the scenes.
2016-05-14 17:54:53	hexnewbie	nutzz: My wild guess on why it's printed twice - stdout is line-buffered, so it's not written immediately, so child and parent print it when existing. You either need to end the line, flush the output or exit the child properly.

2016-05-15 01:09:08	stranglerfish	i dunno like i said i'm unfamiliar with this stuff, i'm just following the tutorial
2016-05-15 01:09:11	stranglerfish	well the thing is
2016-05-15 01:09:16	ElectricTriangle	Kinky_Kitty
2016-05-15 01:09:18	stranglerfish	the information in this is a lot better than the one i was using
2016-05-15 01:09:28	ElectricTriangle	Kinky_Kitty: Give people useful advice and not garbage and they might not ignore you
2016-05-15 01:09:30	farrioth	diegoviola: You should be able to do that with just wget and the right options.
2016-05-15 01:09:35	stranglerfish	the one i was using was easy to set up but it's very uninformative when it covers how code works and such

2016-05-15 01:09:44	stranglerfish	that's the one i was using
2016-05-15 01:10:04	farrioth	diegoviola: rsync would be a good option if you can rsync directly from that server, but if you only have HTTP access, wget is the better solution.
2016-05-15 01:10:20	aricz	stranglerfish: your question is better suited for #opengl .. #lwjgl .. #sdl..
2016-05-15 01:10:30	aricz	stranglerfish: find a good library for using opengl on linux

2016-05-15 08:08:19	pingfloyd	because there wasn't a long enough QA process to filter it out

2016-05-15 08:09:25	pingfloyd	Jaro: so what I do, is stick as close to official stable as possible.  If I find there's a feature missing from the version they provide that I must have, then I use say backports, and if that doesn't have new enough version, I make the pkg myself
2016-05-15 08:09:25	metaspike	and the really old VM's that are actually being used...
2016-05-15 08:09:40	Yehai	what im you use on linux
2016-05-15 08:09:41	Jaro	I gotta say though manjaro unstable,  no issues
2016-05-15 08:09:49	AppAraat	Debian doesn't have SELinux installed by default, so I guess that makes it a bit easier to use. Also Fedora doesn't have Chromium installed in main repos IIRC.
2016-05-15 08:10:01	Jaro	manjaro is kind of like mint.  but you have the option to use unstable repos which is basically same as stable arch i believe

2016-05-15 08:10:29	AppAraat	yeah but I wouldn't trust Manjaro's security model
2016-05-15 08:10:34	Jaro	but like i said it did not like my nvidia prop drivers.  i'm so disappointed

I think it's necessary these days to practice even basic opsec before even worrying about netsec. An example of this would be *not* giving a website real information, so that when the netsec eventually fails and they are hacked, they get nothing from it.

That means using binary packages to give you a stable "point in time" build.

2016-05-16 05:20:34	stoned	A cold boot attack is one such means by which an intruder can defeat encryption despite system security, if they can gain physical access to the running machine. It is premised on the physical properties of the circuitry within memory devices that are commonly used in computers. The concept is that when a computer system has encrypted data open, the encryption keys themselves used to read or write that data
2016-05-16 05:20:37	stoned	are usually stored on a temporary basis in physical memory, in a plain readable form.
2016-05-16 05:20:37	neoncortex	#giant
2016-05-16 05:21:21	stoned	Since this is a physical property of the hardware itself, and based on physical properties of memory devices, it cannot be defeated easily by pure software techniques, since all software running in memory at the point of intervention becomes accessible. As a result, any encryption software whose keys could be accessed this way is vulnerable to such attacks.
2016-05-16 05:21:24	-->	elementalest (~elemental@unaffiliated/elementalest) has joined ##linux
2016-05-16 05:21:47	stoned	Usually a cold boot attack involves cooling memory chips or quickly restarting the computer, and exploiting the fact that data is not immediately lost (or not lost if power is very quickly restored) and the data that was held at the point of intervention will be left accessible to examination.
2016-05-16 05:22:17	stoned	TRESOR is a software approach that seeks to resolve this insecurity by storing and manipulating encryption keys almost exclusively on the CPU alone, and in registers accessible at ring 0 (the highest privilege level) only—the exception being the brief period of initial calculation at the start of a session.
2016-05-16 05:22:30	Miesco	kurahaupo: It gave an error
2016-05-16 05:22:50	stoned	This ensures that encryption keys are almost never available via user space or following a cold boot attack. TRESOR is written as a kernel patch that stores encryption keys in the x86 debug registers, and uses on-the-fly round key generation, atomicity, and blocking of usual ptrace access to the debug registers for security.

2016-05-16 10:08:16	danlii	I have a situation with three separate networks, two of which are non-internet connected, and no routing in between the three at all. Some servers, however, are multi-homed, and have interfaces on all three networks. Since all three use separate DNS servers but the same domain, it creates problems with dns resolution, as we have to choose one of the three to have working dns on. Is ther a nice solution to this perhaps?

2016-05-16 13:37:49	esselfe	jack_rip_vim: http://www.lunar-linux.org/ is pretty cool for building/updating a system from source. There are bugs/compile errors but it's a programmers insight on source-level stuff

2016-05-16 20:03:37	jalt	Hi, currently I have multiple copies of the same file scattered among several subdirectories (but all in same partition) and I am considering replacing them all with hardlinks pointing to the "original" file (from which all copies were made). Is there any negative consequence that I am not considering? Will this affect my backups (7zip-ing the whole directory structure, which include the "original" file and all subdirectories with the copies)? The fs is ext4 on Xu

I want to copy all the content from /simplepath to every single sub folder of /everything/all -- how can I do this? (I need to overwrite all files).

2016-05-19 01:44:26	Levitator	It's not about the voltage, solely. It depends on whether it is contracting your hands and forcing you to grasp a conductor.

2016-05-21 13:14:36	Levitator	In that case, your file permissions are being set to fake uids, so doesn't that have security implications outside the chroot, where the uids and gids on the files are now arbitrary and no correspondent to the real /etc/passwd?
