Probably due to my PS1 (it does not happen when I set it to something simpler) but I have no idea where to start looking beyond that. Here's my slow typing demo of the issue: https://asciinema.org/a/32666?t=50 and  https://github.com/jeroentbt/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/.bashrc. I'd appreciate any guidance/hints.

2016-05-12 06:36:08	sheep	Magnetz74: that's because for whatever silly reason you're entering a different type of quote than the plain ASCII-compatible " and ' quotes

2016-05-12 21:08:39	Zestyr	the past few hours I've been setting up Vim (neovim), and I can't get the gruvbox colorscheme to work. In xterm it looks 'just fine', but in urxvt (rxvt-unicode-256color) it's totally off and not applied correctly. I've tried running the 256 color script in the gruvbox repo, setting the nvim true color variable, and restarting my X server. Nothing

2016-05-12 22:40:43	nabblet	Hi I am a bit confused (new to arch, took over computer from someone else) about the network configuration. I learned that the interface configuration is done in /etc/netctl/ where all the profile files are residing. But I also see eth0 coming up as 192.168.0.2 without any profile file. Instead eth0 seems to be governed by /etc/systemd/network/eth0.network

2016-05-12 22:42:22	kostafey	Namarrgon, I'm not shure it's the same. But whether I have a choice in Arch? I use latest.

2016-05-12 22:42:49	cdown	nabblet: each network manager uses its own configuration location.
2016-05-12 22:42:52	spaceman	how much radically different is the Arch linux kernel from the older Mint kernel?  i noticed i can't use ifconfig as usual.  just wondering to what extent the differences are so i can guage how much im goin to have to relearn.

2016-05-12 22:43:03	cdown	spaceman: nothing to do with the kernel
2016-05-12 22:43:10	cdown	ifconfig is deprecated, and is not in the arch base install
2016-05-12 22:43:16	cdown	if you want it, install net-tools

2016-05-12 22:43:23	nabblet	spaceman: that's not kernel related. the new "ifconfig" is "ip"
2016-05-12 22:43:28	Namarrgon	kostafey: what choice?
2016-05-12 22:44:09	spaceman	i was on the wrong level of understanding then.  it's Arch based those differences then..
2016-05-12 22:44:10	nabblet	Namarrgon: cdown so I should decide either/or?
2016-05-12 22:44:27	cdown	nabblet: yes. pick a network manager and stick with it.
2016-05-12 22:44:29	Namarrgon	nabblet: yes, you shouldn't mix them, it will only lead to pain

My DHCP client should send a packet to 255.255.255.255 on br0 which is connected to eth0 and the router should respond to that with a DHCP offer and my gateway should be set by that offer automatically.

2016-05-12 23:34:26	spaceman	what's lfs?
2016-05-12 23:34:30	knutstrut	spaceman, then read the manual for each package you install, that's a good start.
2016-05-12 23:34:36	fogobogo	linux from scratch

2016-05-12 23:35:06	DarkFeather	I'll second Laki's opinion -- it's so much faster to deploy things on ArchLinux now than any other OS since I know how Arch works and to keep the result small and clean.

2016-05-13 00:05:51	redfish	similarly with vendoring dependencies: go wizards recommend adding all dependencies to your project's repo (!). So, you can't custom compile against a version of a library that you installed on your system via a package manager.
2016-05-13 00:06:12	lupine	redfish: or, they suggest you use submodules
2016-05-13 00:06:16	lupine	both are supported

2016-05-13 10:51:38	Padfoots	evening all, I maintain a few AUR packages and one of them is a kernel module. The install file calls depmod $(uname -r) to update module dependencies on install/update/remove. I am looking at replacing that with a hook but wanted some clarification. Seeing as depmod is owned by the core package kmod, should the hook be in that package or is it not a problem for me to create my own hook?

2016-05-13 15:58:05	MrElendig	there isn't really any reason to use linux-libre on arch

2016-05-13 20:36:36	xananax	But in case I dont...The plan would be, if anyone can confirm it makes sense: unswap the swap partition, unmount it, resize it, create a new boot that's at least 200m in size, set it as boot, unset the first partition as boot, rebuilt grub, `pacman -S linux`. Does it seem legit?
2016-05-13 20:36:53	TheAnachron	grazzolini, ah right! So I need to create a few services for each if-file

2016-05-13 20:41:23	TheAnachron	grazzolini, I cannot imagine why netctl is smart enough to be configured to start/stop wpa_supplicant but then stupid enough not to have the right permissions? UGH
2016-05-13 20:42:05	grazzolini	TheAnachron: because it probably drops privileges
2016-05-13 20:42:11	grazzolini	TheAnachron: or something like that
2016-05-13 20:42:27	TheAnachron	grazzolini, well I guess it just thinks its being run by root and running a sub-command is enough
2016-05-13 20:42:39	TheAnachron	grazzolini, when you check systemctl status -l you will see that it spawns wpa_supplicatn without sudo
2016-05-13 20:43:01	grazzolini	TheAnachron: yes, because system runs things as root, unless told otherwise
2016-05-13 20:43:03	TheAnachron	grazzolini, because it doesnt seem to know it needs sudo to execute the wpa_supplicant.
2016-05-13 20:43:18	TheAnachron	grazzolini, huh? root would be enough, but it seems to be run as normal user.

2016-05-14 03:08:43	clarjon1	Hey guys! Quick question that didn't seem to be answered in the wiki yet. I've a laptop with nvidia optimus, and i've bumblebee and such installed. What would be the most easiest way to configure xorg to ( temporarily at least ) use JUST the nvidia gfx instead of the intel output, short of stripping out bumblebee and configuring that way? Can I just slap an xorg.conf file and disable the bumblebee 
2016-05-14 03:08:43	clarjon1	service to get it done?
2016-05-14 03:09:05	Tazmain	sri, dono, keep getting it, even if they update the driver. 
2016-05-14 03:09:21	Tazmain	sri, but then again a few peopel can vouch for this, i break stuff

2016-05-14 05:54:10	LambdaComplex	raa: Well, a long time ago, /bin was for general commands and /sbin was for system commands (only used by root). Some distros still make that distinction (like CentOS)
2016-05-14 05:54:12	CaptainCoward	raa: having a separate tree of binaries for root doesn't make sense unless you also maintain different versions. since no reasonable distro does that, the arch approach of folding sbin into bin is reasonable
2016-05-14 05:54:48	LambdaComplex	raa: Well, /sbin and /bin were for things that would be needed immediately, and /usr/bin and /usr/sbin were for stuff after boot (so /usr could be on a separate partition)

2016-05-14 11:56:47	MrBougo	if I do ctrl c for a while, it finally shows up

2016-05-14 11:57:22	MrBougo	well, then it's not the right size

2016-05-14 13:21:25	BrainDamage	you meant ascii-7
2016-05-14 13:21:35	Laki	TheAnachron, right, okay. So is there any issues / things you need help with? Removing avahi and remove the 83 packages may break other things if they require those packages
2016-05-14 13:21:44	BrainDamage	incidentally, LANG=C is an ascii charset
2016-05-14 13:22:04	the_gamer	can anybody tell me how to compile an aur-package with _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI set to 0?
2016-05-14 13:22:10	Laki	TheAnachron, I belive there's also an option to remove it but leave in the dependancies that other packages require, you'll have to scout the wiki for that
2016-05-14 13:22:21	cerkauskas	BrainDamage: thank you for the hook :)

2016-05-14 14:45:17	r3dux	Check /etc/fstab in case it has a separate entry for /boot -- if so, perhaps uncomment it but make sure to leave the "/" mount directive alone?
2016-05-14 14:45:33	r3dux	Sorry - perhaps COMMENT the /boot line

2016-05-15 00:41:00	Unitiser	Hi guys, I'm having some issues with my networkmanager since I updated my laptop and I can't figure out how to fix it properly. When arch boots up, it sees my wl interface as a wired interface. To work around it, I run sudo rmmod iwlmvm iwlwifi && sudo modprobe iwlmvm iwlwifi. When it loads for the seccond time, networkmanager detects the wl interface properly and things work like they used to. Anyone has an idea on how to troubleshoot this?

2016-05-15 04:53:46	cryzed	linux_dream, however you seem to h ave installed /usr/share/lxde wallpapers and /usr/share/lxqt themes manually. It's not necessarily harmful as long as you know that you did, but it would be better if you created a PKGBUILD and installed them into your system via pacman -- this allows you to easily keep track of what modifications you did to your system and why, and also easily remove/upgrade them. If you are lucky there 
2016-05-15 04:53:46	cryzed	might be packages in the official repos or the AUR that already package these themes

2016-05-15 09:21:53	bruda	andi_, well you said yourself. it's working on other arch installs, other distros, so it might not be an arch specific issue. But either way it's a problem with Mathworks/Mathlab. 
2016-05-15 09:21:59	CaptainCoward	arch should add support for static libraries
2016-05-15 09:22:40	sheep	CaptainCoward: they're supported if you rebuild the packages that provided them with the static option
2016-05-15 09:23:07	CaptainCoward	well, then my position is they should be supported by default

2016-05-15 13:32:58	justJanne	I use an Intel(R) Ethernet I219-V adapter. It disconnects about every 2 minutes when running on arch, or ubuntu.
2016-05-15 13:33:05	justJanne	Kernel module used as driver is e1000e

Works on Windows fine, but just not under Ubuntu or Arch. Dmesg shows nothing except "NIC down/NIC up", even with debug=16, I tried turning power management and WoL off, and it doesn't seem to change anything.

2016-05-15 19:51:58	sudokode	well, it was built using a different libgcrypt version. that's what happens when pirates suck at their jobs
2016-05-15 19:52:30	sudokode	you can either find the old version and install it somehow, if it doesn't break everything, or find a different copy
2016-05-15 19:52:41	irc-5225225	I would say buy it from GOG, but they don't seem to actually ship the linux version. Steam does, though.
2016-05-15 19:52:41	sudokode	like I said, `ldd <the binary>`
2016-05-15 19:52:41	arcsaber	so i'll have to get all the stuff which is 'not found' when looking at the exe with ldd?

2016-05-15 20:37:03	SysGh0st	sankasan: The neat thing about UEFI is that it can read and boot linux in quite few different ways. One rather common one is to load the kernel image directly. There's no need for a boot loader that way, as the kernel has an "EFISTUB" part in it. One can aslo let other boot laders to manage the load and boot, such as grub. Nice if one needs a fancy boot menu.

2016-05-15 20:46:26	SysGh0st	sankasan: The first step is to let the UEFI find the fat32 formatted ESP partition, once it finds that, it should also find all the EFI executables under it. But in order to get that far, the partition must be directly accessible from the UEFI. Encryptions, raid configurations and such can prevent the UEFI from finding the ESP.

2016-05-15 22:52:03	sankasan	krator44, I prefer to have grub as the bootloader and start Windows through that
2016-05-15 22:52:13	infandum	alad, oh, that's an interesting idea

2016-05-16 08:46:51	samsher	Hello friends, for some reason i can not get sound working on my arch installation with alsa and pulseaudio. in alsa mixer there is only one bar, if i change my sound card hitting F6 in alsamixer i can see all the bars but when i press escape key and enter alsamixer again there is only one bar, that means alsamixer does not save my setting. how to make alsamixer save those settings? do alsa and pulseaudio conflict?

2016-05-16 08:48:01	grawity	you're not supposed to adjust the ALSA devices directly – only make sure it's not muted or anytihng, but generally let pulseaudio manage that for you

2016-05-16 08:48:43	grawity	that's normal
2016-05-16 08:49:00	grawity	the "one bar" thing is a virtual 'pulse' device, to make old ALSA-only programs go through pulseaudio anyway
2016-05-16 08:49:02	samsher	but no sound then
2016-05-16 08:49:04	grawity	it's there to *avoid* conflicts
2016-05-16 08:49:16	grawity	and, changing devices in alsamixer doesn't change anything in alsa

2016-05-16 17:17:18	xelra	Yeah, let's stop this. We all know that Arch is the best distro. That's why we're here. And ranting about anything else is just a waste of time.
2016-05-16 17:17:22	rockhardstar	but is there an actual set of information that guides new users to learning about the kernel?
