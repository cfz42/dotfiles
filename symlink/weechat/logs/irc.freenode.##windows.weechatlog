2016-02-06 14:05:02	clement1	Hi, I am stuck at boot after a failed update with the message "Attempting to revert changes.." on windows7, is there a way to cancel all pending updates from linux ?
2016-02-06 14:05:35	weq	veek: you need to find some 3rd party solution.
2016-02-06 14:05:50	jeffspeff	delete the folder c:\windows\softwaredistribution
2016-02-06 14:05:50	clement1	I tried booting to a windows recovery cd, tried some MISM.exe commands but all of them failed with various error codes
2016-02-06 14:05:56	veek	thanks trying fences
2016-02-06 14:06:07	jeffspeff	clement1, that will remove all information windows has about your updates
2016-02-06 14:06:24	clement1	thanks jeffspeff I'm trying this and coming back here in case it doesn't work
2016-02-06 14:06:26	jeffspeff	it may or may not fix your problem though

2016-02-06 14:17:31	mms_	but unable to get option to install in custom location
2016-02-06 14:17:41	weq	that sounds something more suited for #git
2016-02-06 14:17:49	mms_	the install wizard just does not give that optino
2016-02-06 14:17:51	mms_	ok
2016-02-06 14:17:56	weq	This channel is for operating system related matters
2016-02-06 14:18:15	weq	so think #git might be give more educated advices.

2016-02-06 14:19:42	clement1	one last try before reinstalling windows (and doing a restore image lel), does anyone know how to cancel all pending updates (from unix CLI) so that I can boot again on windows ?

2016-02-06 14:21:38	light	If you're wiping it just hold the power down.
2016-02-06 14:22:45	light	A few crashes during the updates ought to see them fail.
2016-02-06 14:23:14	clement1	see what fail ?
2016-02-06 14:23:22	light	The updates.
2016-02-06 14:23:40	light	Presumably you're stuck in an update loop?
2016-02-06 14:23:45	light	The question wasn't clear.
2016-02-06 14:24:10	clement1	problem is it doesn't even try to install them, looks like it has already began and now as soon as I boot I'm told that it failed and windows is "reverting changes" forever
2016-02-06 14:24:46	light	Boot your install DVD and try rolling back to a restore point further back.
2016-02-06 14:24:50	clement1	heh
2016-02-06 14:25:00	clement1	problem is I don't have a restore point
