2016-05-11 13:52:59	Jester01	are you sure that's in that file?
2016-05-11 13:53:08	mun24	when I tried to load in android Marshamellow or I can also see using scanelf
2016-05-11 13:53:17	mun24	or readelf
2016-05-11 13:53:35	Jester01	what does readelf tell you?
2016-05-11 13:53:42	mun24	wait please
2016-05-11 13:56:14	mun24	I can see one line  0x00000016 (TEXTREL)                    0x0
2016-05-11 13:56:38	mun24	readelf -a libname.so | grep TEXTREL
2016-05-11 13:59:59	Jester01	does your C library have any inline assembly?
2016-05-11 14:00:13	mun24	yes
2016-05-11 14:00:20	Jester01	that's broken.
2016-05-11 14:00:31	Jester01	-fPIC can only fix C code
2016-05-11 14:00:42	mun24	there are quite few lines
2016-05-11 14:00:44	Jester01	if you have hand written assembly that must be PIC itself
2016-05-11 14:00:50	mun24	I mean few assembly files
2016-05-11 14:01:12	Jester01	does scanelf -qT report addresses/functions?
2016-05-11 14:01:21	mun24	yes
2016-05-11 14:01:37	Jester01	then you should be able to pinpoint the exact places

2016-05-11 16:00:25	mun24	is there any way to scan in the assembly file if they are creating text  relocation

2016-05-11 16:32:04	Jester01	looks like your disassembly is in thumb mode when the code is arm
2016-05-11 16:32:31	mun24	is that wrong

2016-05-11 16:33:40	Jester01	I mean this http://pastebin.com/HkLBHs3N  disassembly has been generated in thumb mode

2016-05-11 16:37:12	Jester01	according to the disassembly it didn't make sense, but since that disassembly is wrong, relocations are expected

2016-05-11 16:37:41	mun24	ok
2016-05-11 16:37:46	Jester01	I assume those relocations really apply to the ADRL instructions
2016-05-11 16:38:22	Jester01	now THAT also shouldn't produce relocations
2016-05-11 16:38:39	Jester01	since the manual says: "ADRL produces position-independent code, because the address is PC-relative or register-relative."
2016-05-11 16:38:44	mun24	I can see ADRL in assembly .S files too
2016-05-11 16:39:10	Jester01	we can ONLY see them there because the the disassembly is broken :D
2016-05-11 16:40:14	mun24	I can also see "EXPORT  resp_Plot_b5g6r5_r8g8b8x8_c_g8_m"

2016-05-11 16:45:19	skunkz	Hi everyone, can somebody help me with the retn (c2) instruction? I don't quite understand what it does under the hood, isn't it supposed to pop 1 dword off the stack and put it in $eip, then add n to esp ?
2016-05-11 16:45:55	Jester01	yes
2016-05-11 16:46:16	Jester01	but be careful, that's not usually written as "retn" because people understand that to be "ret near"
2016-05-11 16:46:49	skunkz	Aren't those the same things?
2016-05-11 16:46:53	Jester01	it's "ret n" with a space, or "ret imm16" (but you have given the machine code c2 so that made it clear)
2016-05-11 16:47:37	Jester01	with an actual instruction, you have an operand, e.g. ret 12
2016-05-11 16:47:59	Jester01	retn is also an instruction accepted by some assemblers to mean near return (opcode c3)
2016-05-11 16:48:26	Jester01	sometimes retn 12 is also accepted :)
2016-05-11 16:48:52	Jester01	anyway, the instruction with machine code c2 takes an immediate operand, and it does what you said.

2016-05-11 16:58:36	Jester01	it certainly looks like the reloc is for the adrl but that shouldn't generate reloc, and indeed it doesn't ,here
2016-05-11 16:58:52	Jester01	wherever convenient, for example http://filebin.ca/
2016-05-11 16:59:47	mun24	where are you located?

2016-05-11 23:36:20	v0rt_	hi
2016-05-11 23:36:42	v0rt_	why the args are stored on stack here? http://pastebin.com/CkF929pg
2016-05-11 23:37:00	v0rt_	rbp-0x14 and rbp-0x18
2016-05-11 23:37:00	Jester01	you forgot to enable optimization?
2016-05-11 23:37:15	Jester01	or they are really needed later
2016-05-11 23:37:16	v0rt_	yes, it is not optimized, but I am wondering why
2016-05-11 23:37:21	Jester01	don't
2016-05-11 23:37:38	Jester01	looking at unoptimized code generally makes no sense
2016-05-11 23:38:04	Jester01	in this case, technically arguments are local variables and they need a place in memory so that you can take their address for example
2016-05-11 23:38:15	Jester01	so the compiler generates such code
2016-05-11 23:38:29	<--	GinoManWorks_ (~quassel@50.251.53.110) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-05-11 23:38:45	v0rt_	ok, but why not use rsp or push? :)
2016-05-11 23:38:45	Jester01	at a later stage, if optimization is enabled, it will realize that their addresses are never taken and that data flow doesn't require them to be saved and will remove that
2016-05-11 23:39:13	v0rt_	and why the esp is not moved above if rsp-0xXX is used?
2016-05-11 23:39:14	Jester01	because stack frame pointer use is also enabled
2016-05-11 23:39:30	v0rt_	s/esp/rsp/ I mean
2016-05-11 23:39:39	Jester01	and rsp is not moved because the 64 bit sysv abi allows for a 128 byte red zone
2016-05-11 23:39:54	v0rt_	so those args are stored in red zone?
2016-05-11 23:39:57	Jester01	yes
2016-05-11 23:40:03	v0rt_	ah
2016-05-11 23:40:06	Jester01	also the local variable "c"
2016-05-11 23:40:15	v0rt_	uhm..
2016-05-11 23:40:52	v0rt_	just try to figure out why
2016-05-11 23:41:03	Jester01	why what :)
2016-05-11 23:41:25	Jester01	I explained everything you asked.

2016-05-11 23:45:42	Jester01	in any case, expecting exact same output as some 5 year old article on the web is unrealistic
2016-05-11 23:45:53	Jester01	maybe if you used the exact same compiler version

2016-05-12 01:38:07	|DM|	I know im using a simple c line to test it here, but this is me working out a toolchain to write a bootloader so I hope its ok to ask here

2016-05-12 01:38:49	Jester01	you should just copy out the .text section

2016-05-12 01:39:23	|DM|	I thought binary output means it would take the .text section only?
2016-05-12 01:39:36	Jester01	no, it means binary output without headers :)
2016-05-12 01:39:39	|DM|	I have checked with objdump and the only section with any content is the .text and a comment section
2016-05-12 01:39:57	|DM|	Ahhh, so I guess that other stuff is the comments that gcc sticks on :/ ?
2016-05-12 01:41:04	Jester01	you could use a linker script or check whether ld has an option to only use .text
2016-05-12 01:41:05	vulture	try hexdumping and see if it looks obvious what it stuck in there
2016-05-12 01:41:42	Jester01	you have debug info due to all the .cfi directives for examlpe
2016-05-12 01:41:56	Jester01	and of course the .ident and the .note
2016-05-12 01:42:00	|DM|	The objdump includes a hexdump. Though I guess I'll try strings or if od has some text mode
2016-05-12 01:42:09	Jester01	or just use mc :)

2016-05-13 16:55:11	soulisson	Hi, I asked this question yesterday but it was late, for me machine code is a suite of instructions in written in machine language the same way a C code is a set of instructions written in C language, is that correct?
2016-05-13 16:56:02	Jester01	let's say yes :D
2016-05-13 16:56:19	Jester01	you shouldn't be too worried about such minor details in definition
2016-05-13 16:57:09	OxCEA5ED	and codez are uncountable :-p
2016-05-13 16:57:28	nchambers	If you are writing C code then (type) definitions are pretty unneccesary
2016-05-13 16:59:08	soulisson	Jester01, the wikipedia page confused me, they define machine code and machine language as the same and they see to refer to the instruction set, unless they used the word set here in a broader sense, "Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU)."
2016-05-13 16:59:25	nchambers	its the same thin

2016-05-13 17:00:36	Jester01	it says "a set" not "the set" so they mean the code is a bunch of instructions, not a comprehensive list of all available ones (which is the instruction set)

2016-05-13 23:25:21	ploupz	hi all
2016-05-13 23:25:51	eklonows1i	ARM9: no, are you thinking the second register is used to more easily index vars?
2016-05-13 23:26:04	eklonows1i	in handwriting the asm
2016-05-13 23:26:11	ARM9	yeah
2016-05-13 23:26:32	eklonows1i	i suppose that is not unreasonable
2016-05-13 23:26:42	ARM9	I don't know what var_xx is, above or below the sp (r11)?
2016-05-13 23:27:04	ARM9	I'm assuming it's arguments passed on the stack but I can only guess, you'd think he'd use rbp for those
2016-05-13 23:27:30	ARM9	guess it doesn't really matter as it should be the same size for instructions
2016-05-13 23:28:16	ARM9	nvm I meant local vars
2016-05-13 23:28:23	eklonows1i	arguments are prefaced with arg
2016-05-13 23:28:24	ARM9	the arguments are obviously arg_xx
2016-05-13 23:28:28	eklonows1i	yeah
2016-05-13 23:28:49	eklonows1i	welll, thanks, that is an interesting take i guess I hadn't considered
2016-05-13 23:28:51	ARM9	still, rbp is the conventional frame pointer, so that's probably what most compilers would use
2016-05-13 23:29:46	yoyo	fizzie, yes you are absolutely right. Why would you want to copy the sign bit into all other bit positions? I didnt get that
2016-05-13 23:29:49	eklonows1i	the thing is, through the rest of the code base, it adheres to fastcall meticulously
2016-05-13 23:30:04	eklonows1i	usually when i see handwritten assembly, malware authors will get lazy
2016-05-13 23:30:05	ARM9	since r11 is volatile in all x64 calling conventions they don't have to save/restore it unlike rbp
2016-05-13 23:30:23	ARM9	fastcall?
2016-05-13 23:30:38	ARM9	this is windows no?
2016-05-13 23:30:55	eklonows1i	yeah
2016-05-13 23:31:04	ARM9	windows only has one x64 calling convention afaik
2016-05-13 23:31:21	yoyo	fizzie, kk its just to extend the operand from e.g. 16bit to 32, right? http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/cdq.htm
2016-05-13 23:31:41	fizzie	From 32 to 64 in your case.
2016-05-13 23:32:20	yoyo	yeah okay. and if we would delete the last line "mov eax, edx" it would calculate the division instead of the modulus, right?
2016-05-13 23:32:23	eklonows1i	yeah, but if it were handwritten assembly, I'd think that the author may get lazy and occasionally pass args or vars in non standard registers
2016-05-13 23:32:29	fizzie	Yes.
2016-05-13 23:32:35	eklonows1i	you make a good point though, in that r11 does not need to be restored
2016-05-13 23:32:36	yoyo	okay great thanks
2016-05-13 23:32:52	ARM9	*shrug*
2016-05-13 23:32:54	eklonows1i	thanks for taking a glance anyways
2016-05-13 23:33:12	ARM9	most people I've seen write assembly stick to the calling convention
2016-05-13 23:33:35	vulture	[16.12.24] <eklonows1i> kind of an odd question: does anyone know of a compiler (or compiler optimization option) that commonly moves rsp into another register, and then uses that register to ref stack vars? I haven't seen this before..
2016-05-13 23:33:36	vulture	sure, rbp

2016-05-13 23:33:42	eklonows1i	lol
2016-05-13 23:34:22	vulture	the windows x64 unwind convention even has an opcode for using rbp in that way
2016-05-13 23:34:47	vulture	and using ebp like that is typical in 32 bit
2016-05-13 23:34:49	ploupz	guys where i could found documentation about the pdf file format, the rfc doesn't give all info about that format
2016-05-13 23:34:49	ARM9	but not r11
2016-05-13 23:35:16	vulture	I've seen them stuff into a different register besides rbp on occasion
2016-05-13 23:35:25	eklonows1i	and even so, it is still used to reference local stack vars, whereas the base pointer is usually just for referencing args, yeah?
2016-05-13 23:35:29	--	ybden is now known as always
2016-05-13 23:35:33	vulture	no
2016-05-13 23:35:41	ARM9	I don't think they use rbp to reference anything
2016-05-13 23:35:53	ARM9	the compiler knows where everything is relative to rsp
2016-05-13 23:36:04	vulture	what happens is that with rbp you can use an 8 bit relative offset
2016-05-13 23:36:20	vulture	and if you have a lot of stack var space reserved, you have to drop rsp a lot
2016-05-13 23:36:32	vulture	so rsp+xx, the xx can no longer be an 8 bit offset
2016-05-13 23:36:39	eklonows1i	so it is a space optimization
2016-05-13 23:36:49	--	always is now known as ybden
2016-05-13 23:37:03	vulture	so they cache rbp somewhere below the return address, so that they can maximize the number of both args and locals that can be referenced by rbp+xx
2016-05-13 23:37:05	vulture	with an 8 bit offset

2016-05-13 23:39:20	ploupz	the stack trace is
2016-05-13 23:39:42	ploupz	0412f950 100a64d2 00000001 034c74d0 0412fa3c 0x3432be8 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 file!DllUnregisterServer+0xa12d2

2016-05-13 23:40:01	vulture	Establish the frame pointer register by setting the register to some offset of the current RSP. The offset is equal to the Frame Register offset (scaled) field in the UNWIND_INFO * 16, allowing offsets from 0 to 240. The use of an offset permits establishing a frame pointer that points to the middle of the fixed stack allocation, helping code density by allowing more accesses to use short
2016-05-13 23:40:02	vulture	instruction forms. Note that the operation info field is reserved and should not be used.
2016-05-13 23:40:04	ploupz	wait i past it in pastebin
2016-05-13 23:40:27	vulture	in fact it doesnt mention rbp at all -- so the point is to use <any register> to do that
2016-05-13 23:40:36	vulture	the unwind code allows for any register rather than only rbp
2016-05-13 23:41:03	vulture	ploupz: why not send me the .dmp ? :P
2016-05-13 23:41:19	ARM9	well then
2016-05-13 23:41:30	ploupz	vulture: http://pastebin.com/nwpd5e5q  what i didn't understand is why the instruction before the exception is call    file!DllUnregisterServer+0x6eaa0 (10073ca0)
2016-05-13 23:41:34	eklonows1i	interesting
2016-05-13 23:41:42	ARM9	I certainly learned something today
2016-05-13 23:41:58	ploupz	vulture i could do it but i'll disconnect in less than 10min if u want i send it to u tomorrow
2016-05-13 23:42:13	vulture	yeah, the windows x64 abi is well-designed for optimization in many areas :P
2016-05-13 23:42:22	vulture	(and arguably not for some other areas)
2016-05-13 23:42:53	vulture	ploupz: .dmp file is like 100k, how can you not send that within 10 minutes
2016-05-13 23:42:55	ploupz	i'm just trying to debug a noob application that contain a bug on decode Flate stream
2016-05-13 23:43:09	ploupz	wait i'll do it
2016-05-13 23:46:00	ploupz	vulture: i have to disconnect i'll send it to u tomorrow, it's like 00:00 i need to sleep^^

2016-05-14 08:31:37	repozitor	koisoke, imagine you have a processor that contain trojan in register bank, cashe, bus. everywhere on processor.
2016-05-14 08:32:05	repozitor	can you tell how to write a test pattern to detect it?
2016-05-14 08:32:10	repozitor	do you have any idea?
2016-05-14 08:32:18	csrss	lolwut
2016-05-14 08:32:19	koisoke	software trojan? they don't work that way
2016-05-14 08:32:35	repozitor	koisoke, no, i mean hardware trojan.
2016-05-14 08:33:02	tealdeer	trojan = backdoor no?
2016-05-14 08:33:25	repozitor	trojan isn't backdoor.
2016-05-14 08:33:39	repozitor	it can destroy normal chip activity
2016-05-14 08:33:42	koisoke	then it could very easily be undetectable since obviously any valid instruction stream has to execute with the correct semantics
2016-05-14 08:34:30	koisoke	and there is nothing about a backdoor that must inherently change the user-visible behavior of the cpu
2016-05-14 08:34:31	csrss	that question is so vague that it's unanswerable
2016-05-14 08:34:34	koisoke	^
2016-05-14 08:34:46	Stragus	I don't think you understand how software works
2016-05-14 08:35:00	Stragus	A "trojan" doesn't destroy a chip's activity. It interfers with the OS, at best
2016-05-14 08:35:10	repozitor	all of trojan have trigger and payload.
2016-05-14 08:35:10	repozitor	for example when register 5 contain 0x394839473, then trojan reset program counter
2016-05-14 08:35:10	repozitor	in this example, R5 =0x394839473 is trigger
2016-05-14 08:35:10	repozitor	reseting pc is payload.

2016-05-14 08:36:18	repozitor	csrss, hardware trojan is totally different from software trojan and it's definition.
2016-05-14 08:36:33	repozitor	Xark, yeah, it can be a trojan.
2016-05-14 08:36:50	repozitor	Xark, trigger is F00F and payload is as you know.
2016-05-14 08:37:01	Xark	repozitor: In general, there is no way to detect this.  The "trigger" can be arbitrarily complex.
2016-05-14 08:37:29	repozitor	Xark, i'm searching a way for detect it.
2016-05-14 08:37:50	koisoke	repozitor: there is no way that works in the general case
2016-05-14 08:37:50	repozitor	there are always a way. we just need to find it.
2016-05-14 08:37:52	Xark	repozitor: Good luck, but it seems impossible from software.

2016-05-14 08:38:49	Xark	repozitor: Well, figure if 8 32-bit registers needed to be a certain pattern, that is a 256-bit number you need to "guess".  Forget it.

2016-05-14 08:39:33	repozitor	Xark, so register bank trojan detection is hard, but the other trojan can be detect easier than this.
2016-05-14 08:39:58	Xark	repozitor: Well, you are right, it is actually an easy algorithm (put CPU into all possible states and verify that it doesn't do anything unexpected), just that the running time is much greater than the expected lifetime of the universe.
2016-05-14 08:40:37	repozitor	i'm hardware designer, i know if i design in order to eve can't insert trojan in register bank, so he/she need to insert into another part of processor, like cache, ...
2016-05-14 08:41:04	csrss	repozitor, I don't know where you're going with this question, but as I already mentioned, you haven't specified which type of hardware trojan or what method of modification, etc.
2016-05-14 08:41:07	Xark	repozitor: The possibilities are endless... same deal.
2016-05-14 08:41:16	repozitor	Xark, we don't need to check all state, we just need to check rare state.
2016-05-14 08:41:21	Xark	Hit cache line X, then Y, then Z....then payload.
2016-05-14 08:41:28	koisoke	repozitor: almost all states are rare
2016-05-14 08:41:43	tealdeer	You need to check all states to verify 100% that it's not doing anything it shouldnt
2016-05-14 08:41:48	repozitor	koisoke, disagree
2016-05-14 08:42:06	Xark	repozitor: Define a "rare state"?
2016-05-14 08:42:24	repozitor	Xark, hhhm let me think.
2016-05-14 08:42:48	koisoke	if you fill anything with random bits, almost none of them will mean anything sensible and so will be a "rare state" in practice
2016-05-14 08:42:57	Xark	repozitor: I guess it needs to be unlikely enough to not have too many false triggers, but that leaves a HUGE "state space" (and in modern CPU with cache and MMU and FPU etc. even more insane).
2016-05-14 08:43:16	repozitor	Xark, intel HCF or F00F can be count as rare state
2016-05-14 08:44:21	repozitor	Xark, also in checking trustworthy we can use special hardware inside of processor, or special instruction(priviledge instruction).
2016-05-14 08:44:33	koisoke	lock and cmpxchg8b with bogus operand was something the designers didn't account for
2016-05-14 08:44:44	repozitor	Xark, maybe sometime we need to verify our processor, not always intel.
2016-05-14 08:44:46	koisoke	not a trojan
2016-05-14 08:45:08	koisoke	if you are looking for bugs, then slightly bogus permutations of valid instructions
2016-05-14 08:45:19	koisoke	if you are looking for something deliberate, the search space is much bigger
2016-05-14 08:45:55	csrss	repozitor, let's just be real here. it costs crapload of money to design and manufacture mass for any modern processors.
2016-05-14 08:46:00	repozitor	koisoke, i know search space is so HUGE, but with some trigs we can reduce it.
2016-05-14 08:46:06	csrss	nobody is going to be implementing hardware trojans, unless it's in ucode
2016-05-14 08:46:18	Xark	Yes, and arbitrarily unique.  There could be a running hash on various registers so you need to run a specific pattern through them etc.

2016-05-14 08:50:48	tealdeer	The software then changed the commands issued to the systems and tore them apart

2016-05-14 08:55:30	repozitor	tealdeer, when we made our processor, fabrication can insert trojan also.
2016-05-14 08:55:32	csrss	repozitor, if you're doing a research, you're doing it wrong.
2016-05-14 08:56:12	repozitor	if you own the fabrication, so you can trust it. otherwise they can insert a trojan into your design.

2016-05-14 13:00:48	fizzie	That would be reasonable. (Although more conventionally you'd use a.o, b.o for the object files, and no extension for the executable from gcc.)

2016-05-14 13:01:15	slavking	yeah segfault...
2016-05-14 13:01:28	fizzie	There's no "ret" from either a or b.
2016-05-14 13:02:20	slavking	the program is supposed to endlessly loop
2016-05-14 13:02:24	slavking	the printf
2016-05-14 13:02:33	slavking	should I put a ret in b()?
2016-05-14 13:03:07	fizzie	Uh, if you expect the call "a();" in the C code to ever *return*, in order to get to that printf, you need a ret (or something equivalent) in a as well.
2016-05-14 13:03:24	slavking	still segfaults
2016-05-14 13:03:35	slavking	put a ret in a and b
2016-05-14 13:03:52	slavking	oh god I am supposed to write an operating system by june

2016-05-14 13:04:58	GeDaMo	The beginning of June or the end of June? :|
2016-05-14 13:05:06	slavking	mid-end june
2016-05-14 13:05:08	Jester01	movq 2(%rbp),%rax makes no sense, since you haven't even set up rbp. also we have no idea what you wanted to do there.
2016-05-14 13:05:58	fizzie	I was going to comment that the code doesn't look to be doing anything particularly sensible but shouldn't likely crash, but that was based on constantly reading %rbp as %rsp.
2016-05-14 13:07:06	Jester01	well, without optimization rbp probably has valid value, as it should then be the frame pointer of main ... but we don't know what you really want to do
2016-05-14 13:07:14	slavking	the idea is for the program to constantly loop the printf("") without using a for loop
2016-05-14 13:07:50	fizzie	Oh, so it's trying to store the return address of a into i, and then jump into there from b?
2016-05-14 13:07:51	Jester01	for that you might want to save the return address into i
2016-05-14 13:08:00	Jester01	yeah looks like it
2016-05-14 13:08:49	Jester01	also note that i is 32 bit but return address is 64 bit
2016-05-14 13:09:07	Jester01	you should probably assume that the top 32 bits don't change
2016-05-14 13:09:14	slavking	yes
2016-05-14 13:09:22	Jester01	so "a" should just be mov (%rsp), %eax; mov %eax, i; ret   and "b" the reverse
2016-05-14 13:09:29	slavking	this is the original code, uni exercise for Borland 3.2
2016-05-14 13:09:30	slavking	https://dpaste.de/hk9H
2016-05-14 13:09:47	Jester01	that's 16 bit code
2016-05-14 13:09:49	slavking	yes
2016-05-14 13:10:11	fizzie	And inline in C functions, where the compiler has set up bp appropriately.
2016-05-14 13:10:14	slavking	how do I make i 64 bit
2016-05-14 13:10:22	Jester01	told you so already ^^^
2016-05-14 13:10:34	slavking	i'm trying to do outline assembly
2016-05-14 13:10:42	Jester01	yes
2016-05-14 13:10:49	slavking	then I will try inline I guess
2016-05-14 13:10:52	Jester01	<Jester01> so "a" should just be mov (%rsp), %eax; mov %eax, i; ret   and "b" the reverse
2016-05-14 13:10:56	Jester01	^^^
2016-05-14 13:12:01	fizzie	As above. (Though if you're allowed to modify the C code, you could make it a "long i" instead, so that it has space for all the bits.)
2016-05-14 13:12:02	slavking	mov in gas would be movq?
2016-05-14 13:12:18	Jester01	that's a movl but you don't have to type it out
2016-05-14 13:12:29	Jester01	if the assembler can deduce the size
2016-05-14 13:13:34	slavking	b would be opposite, mov %eax, (%rsp), mov i, %eax, ret?
2016-05-14 13:13:43	Jester01	even more opposite :)
2016-05-14 13:13:48	Jester01	you might want to load eax first
2016-05-14 13:13:55	fizzie	(Incidentally, it's a bit strange how original 16-bit example bothers to carefully save and restore ax.)

2016-05-14 13:16:15	Jester01	gas can be switched to intel
2016-05-14 13:17:10	Rashad	Hello.
2016-05-14 13:17:14	Rashad	I have some code that implements a booth multiplier.
2016-05-14 13:17:17	Rashad	It's the multiplier unit from the Amber core project.
2016-05-14 13:17:21	Rashad	There is a comment in the code that says: 34-bit Booth adder.  The adder needs to be 34 bit to deal with signed and unsigned 32-bit multiplication inputs. This adds 1 extra bit. Then to deal with the case of two max negative numbers another bit is required.
2016-05-14 13:17:26	Rashad	Can someone please explain to me why is this the case?
2016-05-14 13:17:52	slavking	segfaluts again
2016-05-14 13:18:12	slavking	but I'm on the right path

2016-05-14 13:19:32	slavking	but what the hell
2016-05-14 13:19:42	slavking	I think a 32-unsigned number requires 32 bits
2016-05-14 13:19:52	slavking	but a 32-bit signed number requires 1 extra bit
2016-05-14 13:19:59	archivist	nope

2016-05-14 13:20:42	Jester01	from the description I think it's sign-and-magnitude not 2's complement

2016-05-14 13:26:57	Jester01	the way I understood it they use sign-and-magnitude so 1 additional sign bit and 1 carry
2016-05-14 13:27:04	Rashad	The one bit for unsigned is necessary to calculate the two's compliment for a positive number ending with a 1 (e,g: 100).
2016-05-14 13:27:45	Jester01	huh, now that made it unclear all right :D
2016-05-14 13:28:13	Rashad	So the extra bit is to add sign for the unsigned.
2016-05-14 13:28:14	Jester01	slavking: yeah that looks fine, are you sure you are running that code?
2016-05-14 13:29:07	slavking	I guess

2016-05-14 13:32:45	slavking	still I have 2 questions:
2016-05-14 13:32:51	slavking	what does %eax do
2016-05-14 13:32:58	Jester01	Rashad:  we could use more context, such as an example or something
2016-05-14 13:33:10	slavking	oh wait I get it now
2016-05-14 13:33:24	slavking	we put he stack pointer into eax, then save eax into the variable i
2016-05-14 13:33:35	Rashad	Well this is the code where the comment appears: https://github.com/rkrajnc/amber/blob/master/hw/vlog/amber23/a23_multiply.v
2016-05-14 13:33:36	slavking	then we put the variable i into eax, and put eax into the stack poitner
2016-05-14 13:33:52	Jester01	*into memory at the stack pointer
2016-05-14 13:34:19	slavking	(%rsp) is the memory location where the stack pointer points?
2016-05-14 13:34:30	Jester01	yes
2016-05-14 13:34:47	slavking	what's the difference between (%rsp) and %rsp, like a c pointer and a c* (dereferenced pointer)?
2016-05-14 13:35:14	slavking	how do I push variables onto the stack in x86_64?
2016-05-14 13:35:24	slavking	pushq doesn't seem to work sometimes
2016-05-14 13:35:37	Jester01	yes that's the difference except the other way around :)
2016-05-14 13:35:47	slavking	whaat
2016-05-14 13:36:01	Jester01	(%rsp) is the dereferenced and %rsp is the pointer
2016-05-14 13:36:11	slavking	(%rsp) would be like,
2016-05-14 13:36:15	slavking	int* a;
2016-05-14 13:36:22	Jester01	(%rsp)=*%rsp
2016-05-14 13:36:26	slavking	(%rsp) is *a, %rsp = a
2016-05-14 13:36:35	slavking	yes I get it now
2016-05-14 13:36:38	slavking	and offsets?
2016-05-14 13:36:43	Jester01	you just listed it reversed.
2016-05-14 13:36:44	slavking	4(%rsp)
2016-05-14 13:36:58	Jester01	*(%rsp+4)
2016-05-14 13:37:11	Jester01	also you can add index and scale ;)
2016-05-14 13:37:30	slavking	how?

2016-05-14 13:41:04	slavking	what's a section?
2016-05-14 13:41:20	slavking	> section specifies the optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register defaults)
2016-05-14 13:41:30	Jester01	they actually mean segment
2016-05-14 13:41:35	slavking	yes
2016-05-14 13:41:42	Jester01	mostly you can forget them in 64 bit code
2016-05-14 13:41:43	slavking	there's no section
2016-05-14 13:41:55	slavking	yes as 64 bit addresses differently
2016-05-14 13:41:57	slavking	also memory models
2016-05-14 13:42:01	slavking	amirite?
2016-05-14 13:42:10	slavking	memory models also change the way you address memory in 64
2016-05-14 13:42:14	Jester01	but you still have fs and gs
2016-05-14 13:42:48	slavking	I'll leave you guys be for now, time to read some more

2016-05-14 17:56:30	Gynvael	since they want prefetching to work
2016-05-14 17:56:58	Gynvael	the 16-bit there is due to how their memory manager works afair - it groups pages in 64k blocks
2016-05-14 17:57:35	ploupz	hmm so it's not possible to make aslr for full address ?
2016-05-14 17:57:55	Gynvael	ploupz: depends, but generally no due to various alignement requirements

2016-05-14 19:17:35	yoyo	GeDaMo, yup. the sign bit is in edx after that and will be added to eax, right? that code is calculating (a+b)/2, so i dont get the point of getting the sign bit and adding it to eax :o

2016-05-14 19:22:39	yoyo	I can pastebin the c code if that helps
2016-05-14 19:23:03	fizzie	yoyo: It's a division rounding thing. edx is either 0 or -1, depending on the sign.
2016-05-14 19:23:28	fizzie	yoyo: And /2 rounds towards zero, so needs adjusting depending on whether a+b was negative or not.

2016-05-15 01:54:34	Slipspace	Disclaimer: Noob to assembly. Using MASM syntax, is there a way to create an alias to a register, similar to a define in C? I explored macros and they seem to be only suitable for inline procedures.
2016-05-15 01:55:42	Jester01	what does the manual say? :)
2016-05-15 01:56:21	Slipspace	Been reading up on it and haven't found anything that suggests there is, but it's likely I'm missing something.
2016-05-15 01:56:30	Jester01	also note that registers are frequently reused for different things, so it doesn't generally make sense
2016-05-15 01:57:33	Jester01	I don't have masm but have you tried for example https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4dwy6047.aspx
2016-05-15 01:58:35	Slipspace	Will give that a shot.

2016-05-15 02:04:28	Stragus	That makes no sense except for tiny trivial code. Registers are reused constantly
2016-05-15 02:05:35	Slipspace	Some context: For a case study I'm implementing simple script interpreter. For fast instruction interpretation, I'm using what is essentially an assembly version of GCC's computed goto. Instruction operands are stored in common registers. This works fine but register usage is starting to become virtually unreadable.
2016-05-15 02:06:51	Jester01	you can run the C preprocessor on your asm file (gcc does this automatically for .S files, but since you mention masm that hardly applies)

2016-05-15 02:13:44	Slipspace	Well I suppose I could just run the assembly through a C/MASM compiler that spits out MASM and feeds it to the assembler.
2016-05-15 02:16:59	Stragus	I have used the preprocessor abundantely when compiling .S files with GCC, it's very handy
2016-05-15 02:17:20	Stragus	To output the offsetof() of struct members as #define symbols, to be used in the assembly
2016-05-15 02:17:26	Stragus	And much more...

My asm listing is here : http://codepaste.net/4uriko. Assembling, linking and execution through GDB is here : http://pastebin.com/6cXFHPxr . Thank you for the help.
2016-05-15 15:45:58	Jester01	you can't return from main if you don't use the C library.

2016-05-15 15:59:20	Jester01	told you so :)
2016-05-15 16:00:00	Jester01	in somewhat more detail, the C library has code that calls your main so when you ret control goes back to the c library which then exits properly
2016-05-15 16:00:23	Jester01	without libc you can't ret because nobody called your main, you need to use an exit syscall
2016-05-15 16:01:06	otherflow	ho, i see. Ty

2016-05-15 16:05:21	Jester01	it's a bad idea to have address 0 mapped, because you can't catch null pointers then

2016-05-15 16:05:50	Jester01	it's doubly bad if writing through a null pointer can mess up something as important as the IDT :)

2016-05-15 16:07:11	DaniKitten	Must I write the GDT manually?

2016-05-15 16:07:39	DaniKitten	I can write LGDT [gtdr]
2016-05-15 16:08:05	DaniKitten	[gtdr] means a memory pointer, to the GDT pointer and size

2016-05-15 20:40:59	AverageJ0e	but that would mean i would need to patch it without it being run because the address of those functions in the iat isnt known at runtime then?

2016-05-15 20:52:15	vulture	if you dont know whether the import you want is actually in the IAT of a given exe, though, then you could just go the LDR route

2016-05-16 16:06:06	APic	Seriously.
2016-05-16 16:07:17	vulture	frib: where did you see int 98
2016-05-16 16:14:07	frib	vulture, in a packed exe
2016-05-16 16:14:29	vulture	show the context?
2016-05-16 16:14:40	frib	you mean surrounding code?

2016-05-16 16:17:45	frib	vulture, it's a disassembler it's not like I coded in capslock :)
2016-05-16 16:18:07	vulture	:P
2016-05-16 16:18:25	vulture	you just need a real disassembler that doesnt do that

2016-05-16 16:19:02	vulture	in any case, I'd be interested in seeing the code. I've never seen an int 98 before. I would think it doesnt exist. but that maybe if you call it it generates an exception or something that gets caught

2016-05-16 16:23:10	frib	 at the same time, when I came across it, which I am unable to do again (don't remember how to get to it), the code didn't seem "Abnormal", and seeing as it does get a handle to some kind of timer object it's also likely that it was intended to keep a track of runtime

2016-05-16 20:51:20	hexorg	this is x86 btw
2016-05-16 20:51:21	GeDaMo	ret does not alter the flags
