2016-05-13 03:19:22	BaneAliens	but my debugging tells me otherwise
2016-05-13 03:19:32	BaneAliens	so if I have a char foo = 255
2016-05-13 03:19:59	daey	unsigned char?
2016-05-13 03:20:15	BaneAliens	meaning all bits are set to 1. If I do foo = foo << 4, and then foo = foo >> 4. We still have foo set to 255. I was expecting foo to have 15
2016-05-13 03:20:40	BaneAliens	isn't char always unsigned?, or is that another mistake?

2016-05-13 11:15:30	IcyFoxy	One problem here is that libsodium's crypto_box{,_seal}, etc commands take a block of known size; and do not maintain a state to stream through more data.

2016-05-13 11:15:35	eft	if its manual through stdin then you can rely on a fairly small buffer, since processing will happen significantly faster than input data will arrive
2016-05-13 11:15:54	IcyFoxy	So; I may have to do something a bit more manual with the streams directly.

2016-05-13 11:16:48	IcyFoxy	Expected throughput. For the immediate future, nothing as this is mostly just experimenting with C; although samples could include mail. And compression could be suitable.
2016-05-13 11:16:50	eft	as long as your buffer (at the offset you provide) has a length greather than or equal to the length you tell it, you can rest assured that it's OK
2016-05-13 11:17:03	eft	in that case, i think youre overthinking it a bit :)

2016-05-13 11:17:55	IcyFoxy	Although one this I am not sure about is .. if I should output multiple max_sized crypto_box objects when using stdin/stdout; and single boxes when using files.
2016-05-13 11:18:07	IcyFoxy	Basically just stdin not being a file = the problem :

2016-05-13 11:18:41	CaZe	Why is it a problem?

2016-05-13 11:19:35	twkm	not in c.  and perhaps not even outside it.
2016-05-13 11:19:37	eft	sure... you can always realloc your buffer size when reading from stdin
2016-05-13 11:19:38	IcyFoxy	And with a memory map; that can be directly used as the input
2016-05-13 11:19:39	CaZe	But you can't always allocate a buffer large enough to hold the buffer. Nor would you always want to.

2016-05-13 11:30:56	IcyFoxy	I'll have to do both anyway. If the output is a file, the memmap allows for an optimization when available.
2016-05-13 11:31:17	IcyFoxy	So I guess not an assumption but a compile time option then.
2016-05-13 11:33:02	twkm	better be, as the lack of a memmap function would otherwise be fatal.

2016-05-13 16:43:11	nchambers	for example, in haskell (which does lazy eval), you can have this: [1..] which spawns an infinite list. if you do: take 20 [1..], then it will lazily evaluate the list, meaning it says "ok. I see you want that, but I'll only get you exactly what you need", which in this case is the first 20 elems
2016-05-13 16:43:27	nchambers	thats a poor explanation, but its very different from short circuiting.

2016-05-13 22:41:25	Arch-TK	I know, but that reason to "hate" (even though I still wouldn't use that word) X has by now disappeared and it has now become more usable (even though X itself hasn't changed)
2016-05-13 22:41:43	IceKarma	Arch-TK, in your opinion
2016-05-13 22:41:48	bone	most of the problems i've had with X involved package upgrades that ended up mucking the API/ABI some how for 3rd party drivers.
2016-05-13 22:41:50	IceKarma	Arch-TK, I have long felt that X is a steaming pile of garbage
2016-05-13 22:41:56	Arch-TK	IceKarma: you must understand, I am not disputing the fact that X sucks, I am simply asking you to give me reasons why YOU hate X _now_
2016-05-13 22:42:08	IceKarma	Arch-TK, I hate using X, I hate developing for X
2016-05-13 22:42:10	xiphias	most of the problems i've had with X is that it was designed for a specific use case which doesn't apply to the modern world
2016-05-13 22:42:11	Arch-TK	IceKarma: sure, that's a good description, but does it warrant "hate"
2016-05-13 22:42:15	IceKarma	Arch-TK, if I had my druthers, I'd never do either one of them ever again
2016-05-13 22:42:19	xiphias	why do you care what he feels towards it

2016-05-14 02:50:36	Tazmain	so a fucntion prototype , does type conversion, what is meant by in the abstance of a function prototype, the function prototype I am a little confused on
2016-05-14 02:50:38	c721	yeah I dunno, is that the right way to access the next node in a linked lise
2016-05-14 02:51:07	Tazmain	is that like declaring a fucntion in the header?
2016-05-14 02:51:13	Tazmain	in a header file
2016-05-14 02:51:17	ZeZu	c721,  yes
2016-05-14 02:51:45	c721	oh thanks
2016-05-14 02:52:07	ZeZu	Tazmain, a prototype for a function is just declaring it ahead of time so you can use it before the compiler gets to the actual definition
2016-05-14 02:52:40	Tazmain	right, is there a example somewhere?
2016-05-14 02:52:45	ZeZu	IE:  if he were to proto his list_len(); before the main() {}  then write the function after
2016-05-14 02:52:55	Tazmain	oh
2016-05-14 02:52:59	Tazmain	that way
2016-05-14 02:53:06	ZeZu	if he just moves it below the main and tries to use it, the compiler will complain
2016-05-14 02:53:10	Tazmain	delphi does that,
2016-05-14 02:53:16	c721	hmm

2016-05-14 02:53:30	ZeZu	but if he puts the proto above or in a header,  it will be fine with it as long as it finds it in compiled output when it links
2016-05-14 02:53:46	sheilong	I done read K&R I want to read another book now
2016-05-14 02:53:50	ZeZu	c721,  which is part of your problem as i said,  your function is inside another function
2016-05-14 02:54:14	Tazmain	wait wait, so if you have a function called, doSomething(), then it would be doSomething( int i); int main() {} doSomething(int i) {} right ?
2016-05-14 02:54:27	ZeZu	That's also c++ code,  if you're supposed to be writing C code ... i have no idea

2016-05-14 02:56:21	ZeZu	No it's valid in C,  but the linked list code he's using is STL i believe

2016-05-14 02:59:42	ZeZu	and the type conversion you were talking about,  for functions that is generally not how it works, you can overload them just by using the same function name with different type params or return values,  or else the compiler will do "implicit" type conversion where it's just automatically converting params or return values just like any other value ( if that make sense to you )

2016-05-14 07:23:04	parco	would i have another member be an enum type that describes "TYPE_FLOAT, TYPE_INT, etc?"

2016-05-14 07:23:41	parco	i'll have to look that up

2016-05-14 07:40:45	jack_rabbit	That's probably the proper attitude.
2016-05-14 07:41:16	jack_rabbit	parco, in my experience, they don't actually teach people how to program properly in computer science programs.
2016-05-14 07:41:21	parco	i'd be interested in learning about how to draw up state machines, and general brainstorming techniques for programming
2016-05-14 07:41:47	parco	my old plug and chug is causing me to rip up tons of code and redo it

2016-05-14 07:42:53	nisstyre	let alone design them
2016-05-14 07:42:57	jack_rabbit	And eventually, you'll get intuition about how to structure your programs so you'll have to do less restructuring later on.
2016-05-14 07:43:02	nisstyre	you should just sit with a pad of graph paper maybe

2016-05-14 07:43:51	eft	yeah i agree
2016-05-14 07:44:48	nisstyre	they should be able to program, but also be able to use concepts in CS to solve computational problems and design reliable and correct software

2016-05-14 08:01:01	Dama	http://pastebin.com/a6KBsF6q - trying to do matrix multiplication
2016-05-14 08:01:23	Dama	using threading
2016-05-14 08:02:08	eft	Dama, theres some decent matrix libraries for C that I would probably use instead of writing my own
2016-05-14 08:02:14	Dama	however it is only returning output in 3x3 blocks across the diagonals array (when size is 12x12 using 4 threads)
2016-05-14 08:02:31	eft	get it working with a single thread first, then parallelize it
2016-05-14 08:02:32	Dama	ah this is more just to get an idea about threading and what not, im new to C
2016-05-14 08:02:41	eft	ah i see

2016-05-14 08:14:33	b|ackwolf	also char (string).
2016-05-14 08:14:39	jack_rabbit	char is not string.
2016-05-14 08:14:47	jack_rabbit	And it's not char. It's pointer to char.
2016-05-14 08:15:00	jack_rabbit	You have an array of pointer to char, so every element is of type pointer to char.
2016-05-14 08:15:17	b|ackwolf	right/
2016-05-14 08:15:31	jack_rabbit	So ptr[1] is of type char *
2016-05-14 08:15:37	jack_rabbit	But *ptr[1] is type char.

2016-05-14 08:17:42	masoudd	replace *(pointer + 1) with pointer[1].
2016-05-14 08:18:09	ethos	also whats a moog
2016-05-14 08:18:11	masoudd	So you don't get the difference between pointer[1] and *pointer[1]
2016-05-14 08:18:26	jack_rabbit	b|ackwolf, pointer[1] is equivalent to *(pointer + 1). So if you do *pointer[1], you're doing the equivalent of **(pointer + 1)
2016-05-14 08:18:56	b|ackwolf	fair enough.
2016-05-14 08:19:31	jack_rabbit	b|ackwolf, the array syntax is essentially a dereference operator at an offset into an array.
2016-05-14 08:19:32	masoudd	I think you just got promoted to a 2 star programmer.

2016-05-14 08:20:23	jack_rabbit	b|ackwolf, so pointer[1] says "give me the object at offset 1" whereas *(pointer + 1) says "increment pointer by 1 and then dereference it (give me the object at that location)"
2016-05-14 08:20:40	b|ackwolf	masoudd: not yet ;)
2016-05-14 08:20:46	b|ackwolf	jack_rabbit: thanks for your time.
2016-05-14 08:20:52	jack_rabbit	Does that make sense?
2016-05-14 08:20:58	xiphias	2 star programmers read the entire set of knuth books cover to cover
2016-05-14 08:21:19	xiphias	3 star programmers make use of that knowledge, 4 star programmers are those who do not go insane
2016-05-14 08:21:37	ethos	jack_rabbit: When we're offsetting by 1, is that effectively saying increment contiguous memory by 32 bits?
2016-05-14 08:21:59	jack_rabbit	ethos, it increments it by the size of the object stored in the array.
2016-05-14 08:22:17	eft	xiphias, i think reading the knuth books cover to cover is a career long endeavor
2016-05-14 08:22:26	xiphias	indeed

2016-05-14 08:23:01	jack_rabbit	ethos, So if I have a struct thats a killobyte big, pointer[1] will move a killobyte into the array and get the object stored there.
2016-05-14 08:23:24	jack_rabbit	(given pointer is of type some_kylobyte_struct[]
2016-05-14 08:23:25	ethos	jack_rabbit: Ahh okay, so if you instantiate an array of an object, the array already knows the memory difference between different index in the array

2016-05-14 15:50:34	Zhivago	Start by figuring out the difference between a function and a procedure.
2016-05-14 15:50:51	koro	My statement that some programmers don't need to use calculus, depending on what they code is circular because I agree that many programmers do use calculus?
2016-05-14 15:51:05	koro	fstd: Maybe you need to be more specific.
2016-05-14 15:51:17	IceKarma	koro, I think fstd is complaining about a different line
2016-05-14 15:51:43	IceKarma	koro, conflating the one about 'mathematicians' with the one about 'people who don't (=programmers)'
2016-05-14 15:51:48	fstd	"depending on what they code" is basically "provided they don't code anything that requires calculus"
2016-05-14 15:51:53	qi	it's not important
2016-05-14 15:52:05	koro	fstd: what I was implying is that such code exists and such programmers exist.

2016-05-14 15:52:23	koro	Just like mathematicians who don't use calculus in their work also exist.
2016-05-14 15:52:23	noethics	let's debate the semantics of whether it's still calculus if they use it by accident
2016-05-14 15:52:36	IceKarma	qi, I think that's a good way to put it.
2016-05-14 15:52:41	koro	It's really a matter of what kind of programming/math you do.

2016-05-14 15:53:23	koro	Claiming "any programmer that is worth anything uses calculus" which is what Zhivago seemed to imply is a bit bold.
2016-05-14 15:53:42	qi	i don't think Zhivago is claiming they use calculus. he's claiming they use mathematics
2016-05-14 15:53:43	Zhivago	I implied no such thing.
2016-05-14 15:53:54	koro	I guess I misunderstood your statement then.
2016-05-14 15:54:09	koro	Oh but we were talking about calculus.
2016-05-14 15:54:10	Zhivago	I claimed that many programmers are stuck in a mechanical mindset and do not use mathematical reasoning.
2016-05-14 15:54:20	Zhivago	And for those people mathematics is largely irrelevalt.
2016-05-14 15:54:30	koro	Okay, we agree.
2016-05-14 15:54:39	Zhivago	But they're also doing things in the most complex and fragile fashion.
2016-05-14 15:55:04	noethics	do you think language choice reflects that :P
2016-05-14 15:55:08	qi	Zhivago: i feel like programming is taught in a way that makes that quite likely
2016-05-14 15:55:09	kisb	matlab programmers
2016-05-14 15:55:21	Zhivago	qi: Factory workers are in high demand.
2016-05-14 15:55:25	noethics	most mathematicians i know use haskell
2016-05-14 15:55:48	noethics	are they considered programmers?
2016-05-14 15:56:02	kisb	yes
2016-05-14 15:56:07	kisb	engineers even
2016-05-14 15:56:08	qi	if they program, i would think so, yes
2016-05-14 15:56:14	qi	(i wouldn't call them engineers)
2016-05-14 15:56:20	noethics	seems like sample bias
2016-05-14 15:56:26	qi	why?
2016-05-14 15:56:36	noethics	because they're not a "programmer" by trade
2016-05-14 15:57:02	qi	oh. if you mean they use haskell at home for fun, sure

Giving you know the incoming format, convert it when read and now you don't have to worry locally.

2016-05-14 23:12:47	bone	right, but basically you need to parse the entire file in one shot as one object, you don't have non-json delimiters.
2016-05-14 23:13:27	rooftopjoe	bone: yep. that shouldn't be a problem.
2016-05-14 23:13:55	rooftopjoe	should i just count the size of strings and then seek back in the file and read them in a buffer i allocate?

2016-05-14 23:14:14	bone	if you're dealing with unixy platforms, you can just allocate exactly the size of the file with some accounting for null terminators.  on windows you would have to worry about newline translation, but generally the file size should still be larger than the buffer required to hold it.

2016-05-14 23:15:44	rooftopjoe	here's how i represent json data
2016-05-14 23:15:51	rooftopjoe	it's a recursive tree
2016-05-14 23:15:55	bone	your libc is most likely going to be buffering the file up to some amount anyway, so reading it byte by byte is more cpu time, a re-allocation strategy isn't uncommon, and you generally wouldn't need to do it that often.
2016-05-14 23:15:59	rooftopjoe	i can populate it as i go along
2016-05-14 23:17:04	bone	well, that's the most efficient, if you're doing the parsing yourself and aren't bound by library constraints.

2016-05-14 23:19:29	rooftopjoe	since it likely does do all the buffering transparently, etc. it should probably accomodate this

So, for example, the status 0x83 tells us that a Note Off message was received from channel 4"
2016-05-15 02:53:18	Moose	I *know* word by word comparison is more efficient than octet by octet comparison. It's *likely* that memcmp will do octet by octet comparisons, but I don't know what it actually does.

2016-05-15 02:55:24	Moose	twkm, fair enough I assumed that memcmp would be slower. I apologize for insulting the developers of the implementation of memcmp I am using and for assuming it would be slower.

2016-05-15 07:40:58	fengshaun	I have a main thread which does stuff constantly and spawns new long running threads to do their own thing. Child threads need to send events to main thread about their status periodically or when things change. Is there a "best practice" way to do this? I have thought about pipes and a global persistent event queue. Am I missing a better way to do it?
2016-05-15 07:42:32	danielcamiel	there's many ways, just a matter of what works for your program
2016-05-15 07:42:55	fengshaun	main thread has an event loop that responds to external events and I want to avoid having to check the status of every thread on a timer
2016-05-15 07:43:05	danielcamiel	look up IPC techniques I s'pose
2016-05-15 07:43:26	fengshaun	I have, there's posix message queues which also works

2016-05-15 09:55:14	fengshaun	now, once you are done with the first allocation, THEN you allocate a new block and use that
2016-05-15 09:55:30	fengshaun	before you allocate with cloned()
2016-05-15 09:55:45	fengshaun	because as we just said, cloned allocates a new block

2016-05-15 12:24:16	Emil	suppose I declare a variable

2016-05-15 12:26:59	Emil	(also an additional question, isn't casting just simply telling the compiler that yes, this is exactly what I want and it doesn't actually transform much really)

2016-05-15 14:37:34	Arch-TK	If your compiler is decent, scoping things within a do { } while (0); won't cause you any harm in most cases, and if you do need such fine grained control, why are you writing a compiled language?
2016-05-15 14:37:44	Emil	but I claim (as most do) that that isn't the case and C is pretty tightly wound the the compiler and the machine code it produces
2016-05-15 14:37:54	kate	Emil: they are not moot; they are simply in terms of a particular set of implementations. C is specified abstractly, by a language standard

2016-05-15 15:07:45	kate	that's due to what values are permitted for representations of pointers, not to a particular OS. imagine for example that your architecture has a bus for words, and that addressing a byte within a word would need some extra bits (to state which byte)
2016-05-15 15:08:17	kate	so when implementing C, you might provide int * using that word address, and then char * would be provided as a word plus some extra bits. so sizeof (char *) > sizeof (int *) for those kind of machines
2016-05-15 15:08:26	Arch-TK	Oh, I know you can probably get a SIGBUS on windows... you wouldn't see it though... it would be covered up by a generic error message

2016-05-15 15:59:53	b|ackwolf	fizzie: just to showing explicit cast?
2016-05-15 15:59:55	Xgc	Several issues, some of which b|ackwolf hadn't recognized.
2016-05-15 16:00:29	Xgc	b|ackwolf: It's best not to use the cast at all.  It suggests the developer doesn't understand C.  The cast does nothing.
2016-05-15 16:00:36	b|ackwolf	Xgc: I'm doing code review. I didn't read the entire code yet.
2016-05-15 16:00:48	fizzie	b|ackwolf: Well, see kate's comment about the function pointer casts. But there's no reason to cast lineptr. (It's not cast on line 56, even though readlines and myqsort have exactly the same type for the first parameter.)
2016-05-15 16:01:22	Xgc	b|ackwolf: Typically, when you see a cast, you expect it to do something wonderful, since casts are usually not necessary.  Now you'll confiuse the reader.
2016-05-15 16:01:52	fizzie	"Wonderful" is a nice, positive word for it.
2016-05-15 16:02:04	Xgc	b|ackwolf: The function pointer cast is just wrong... which is must different than "not needed".
2016-05-15 16:03:15	b|ackwolf	Xgc: I understand the functionality of casting. but there I didn't see any mismatch type or something need to cast.

2016-05-15 16:04:20	Xgc	b|ackwolf: The called function (that takes the function pointer as an argument) is expecting a different type.  You are not allowing the correct conversion to occur.
2016-05-15 16:06:18	Xgc	b|ackwolf: In this case, you really don't want a conversion.  You want to pass the correct type... and have the called function handle the void* pointers properly.

2016-05-15 19:34:03	qi	are you a spammer?
2016-05-15 19:34:40	fizzie	clang at least earlier had just a specific "for loop has empty body" warning, but that's less specific -- http://sprunge.us/KigS -- though I wouldn't be surprised if a sufficiently new clang would also have the misleading-indentation one.
2016-05-15 19:34:45	daniel-s	Hey. I noticed that I have several functions to traverse a list. They're almost all about 80% the same with only 1 or 2 lines between them. This is an example.

2016-05-15 23:26:18	@candide	There is no need to cast the result of library functions that return void *; it makes your code hard to read, adds no value, and can hide a bug if you don't have a valid prototype in scope. See http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html

2016-05-15 23:30:59	twkm	another malloc.
2016-05-15 23:31:08	twkm	then you aren't writing c.
2016-05-15 23:31:26	patrick99e99	not sure what you mean by that twkm

2016-05-15 23:32:18	twkm	in c a variable of type short * can be assigned a value of type void *.  thus you aren't writing c, even if you think you are -- you are writing c++.
2016-05-15 23:32:41	patrick99e99	twkm: ok so then I need a cast?
2016-05-15 23:32:50	twkm	you need a different channel.
2016-05-15 23:32:58	twkm	##c++ for example.
2016-05-15 23:33:20	patrick99e99	my question wasnt about that in the first place.. i just did what was suggested because of the "It had been 2 days and 2 minutes since someone casted malloc (see !dontcastmalloc)."
2016-05-15 23:33:51	twkm	never the less, if you aren't writing c this is the wrong place.

2016-05-16 05:03:32	Harry	Hi guys. have a question. is there a possibility to trigger a kinda 'IFTT' in a program? say, I wanna call a function from main repetitively till something happens inside the function, say it prints out an error message. could main detect whats happening inside the called function?
2016-05-16 05:04:02	<--	capsloth (~tessio@187.64.117.252) has left ##c ("Leaving")
2016-05-16 05:04:36	fstd	you can let main know by returning from the function
2016-05-16 05:04:59	fstd	which is what you're doing anyway if calling repeatedly from main
2016-05-16 05:05:13	Harry	of course, but thats not gonna work for me in this particular case
2016-05-16 05:05:41	Zhivago	Have the function called return to main some status.
2016-05-16 05:05:55	Zhivago	Why won't that work?

2016-05-16 05:06:51	Harry	the function is meant to return a value, but in it is built an error detection. the value returned in case of an error could be a legit value too

2016-05-16 05:07:31	hyphenated	so either pass in an additional parameter that the function sets, or return a struct type containing more than one value
2016-05-16 05:07:35	Zhivago	So, update something else also.
2016-05-16 05:07:45	Zhivago	e.g., while (foo(x, &status));
2016-05-16 05:08:49	Harry	ok, thanks for the suggestions. was looking for a shortcut, I guess there isn't :)

2016-05-16 14:35:05	Arch-TK	thican: do you put () around every pointer before using the indirection operator?
2016-05-16 14:36:22	thican	Arch-TK: I used to do it when I have ambiguous reading examples, like object->list[position]
2016-05-16 14:36:43	Arch-TK	then why do it here? temp = malloc(sizeof(*(temp)));
2016-05-16 14:37:07	Arch-TK	and also, sizeof is not a function (just an FYI)
2016-05-16 14:37:08	thican	and by experience, I prefer to surcharge with brackets than having a bug
2016-05-16 14:37:52	Arch-TK	spamming brackets everywhere just makes everything harder to read and harder to debug... Simply being aware of the operator precedence can go a long way to cleaner code.
2016-05-16 14:37:56	thican	I know it's not a function, but I find this way more readable
2016-05-16 14:38:09	thican	well, for me, it's easier

2016-05-16 14:42:33	Arch-TK	your function is also excessively long
2016-05-16 14:42:38	Arch-TK	it makes it difficult to read
2016-05-16 14:42:47	thican	I used perror
2016-05-16 14:43:15	Arch-TK	yes, your method of sprintf into a string and then perror is really convoluted, additionally, you're not checking sprintf for an error return
2016-05-16 14:43:50	Arch-TK	you could throw this all into an error function and, if your program doesn't care about handling errors, just make it exit(EXIT_FAILURE); at the end
2016-05-16 14:44:26	thican	Still better than doing nothing

2016-05-16 20:21:03	chris_	now it should compile and it should swap two pointer values

2016-05-16 20:30:40	MrJones	anyway, an obvious mistake in that loop is: tausche(); lacks parameters, you need to specify some.

2016-05-16 20:31:36	briankc	Is umkehren() supposed to reverse the array?

2016-05-16 20:32:18	MrJones	so maybe take some time to think about that and how you could use a second pointer in the loop
2016-05-16 20:32:20	chris_	and the pointer should point to the array -> ifeld

2016-05-16 20:32:50	chris_	the while loop should reverse with the first func tausche

2016-05-16 20:32:57	MrJones	hint: you'll need the start and also the end of the array as an argument to "umkehren", or at the minimum the start and the length. otherwise you can't do it
2016-05-16 20:33:10	MrJones	and you'll need to have something other than z_i in addition in your loop

2016-05-16 20:33:31	chris_	is != '\0' correct ???
2016-05-16 20:33:39	MrJones	actually no, it isn't
2016-05-16 20:33:59	MrJones	the reason is that char* arrays containing C strings are usually null-terminated (by convention, not by necessity)
2016-05-16 20:34:07	MrJones	however, that is not the case for your int[] array
2016-05-16 20:34:19	chris_	ok then i was on the right way
2016-05-16 20:34:35	chris_	and this was the answer to my question, well part of
2016-05-16 20:34:40	MrJones	you would either need the last element to be an actual zero (and you should use != 0 for readability), or you need to pass your function the array size in addition
2016-05-16 20:34:42	chris_	thank youuu

2016-05-16 20:35:03	chris_	ahhh
2016-05-16 20:35:05	chris_	ok
2016-05-16 20:35:56	MrJones	char* arrays also usually contain a literal "\0" (ascii 0) byte at the end, but you CAN remove it and then that check won't even work with such a char array. it's really just a convention for strings that is usually used to allow this sort of "ending" check for strings in C
2016-05-16 20:36:32	MrJones	something to keep in mind. so "\0" really only works with char* arrays, and only if they are filled in expected ways adhering to the nullterminated string convention
2016-05-16 20:36:40	chris_	but z_i has the value of ifeld[10] ....
2016-05-16 20:37:04	MrJones	[10] is part of the type
2016-05-16 20:37:08	MrJones	ifield is of type int[10]

2016-05-16 20:37:18	MrJones	however, z_i is of type int* (which has no idea about the size)
2016-05-16 20:37:32	jv	it's trivial then to do s = zero_term_array; while(*s++) { ... }
2016-05-16 20:37:34	MrJones	you can convert int[10] to int* in C, but it's lossy. (there is no way to obtain the size after the conversion)
2016-05-16 20:38:03	twkm	char * arrays.  ugh.
2016-05-16 20:38:14	twkm	that have literal "\0" at the end.  sigh.
2016-05-16 20:38:21	MrJones	the usual way to fix this is to pass sizeof(ifield) as a second parameter (e.g. of type int or size_t - any large enough integer type will do)

2016-05-16 20:43:43	esselfe	I once worked with char arrays and put accompanying 'unsigned int varname_size;' which was set using 'strlen' (which uses the '\0' char ^^) ... just so I didn't have the '\0' in some specificly-formatted text.

I mean the language definition's pretty much there to stifle any creativity so you get the same tired old shit anywhere so if you're going by the language def v.s. an actual implementation it'd be unreasonable to expect anything useful in that regard lol

2016-05-19 01:15:19	kate	in particular, i can't see how this could possibly be called stupid shit:
2016-05-19 01:15:21	kate	<bone> if you call into some piece of code, and that code needs to persist the string, it makes no sense for it to hang onto the pointer not knowing the callers usage of the pointer.

2016-05-19 01:16:12	Smilex	are you serious? I never deal with memory management
2016-05-19 01:16:22	kate	have you never called malloc?

2016-05-19 01:19:07	Smilex	Metaluim: Yes I see that. There's an assumtion here on my part that the person asking wants to be a programmer and was told off from C, because of memory managment

2016-05-21 13:10:42	wraith	can you explain why

2016-05-21 13:11:02	Arch-TK	please don't call variables "counter"

2016-05-21 13:11:12	Arch-TK	"i" is perfectly good enough
2016-05-21 13:11:35	jack_rabbit	wraith, randVal is uninitialised when you print it. It might contain any kind of garbage. It has no meaningful value when you print it.
2016-05-21 13:11:37	twkm	size has no real purpose.  though i suppose it might eventually.
2016-05-21 13:11:41	naf	Arch-TK,

2016-05-21 13:13:03	jack_rabbit	Arch-TK, Yes, but that seems like the smallest of the problems here.
2016-05-21 13:13:08	Arch-TK	And excessive verbosity can hinder readability. Especially in cases where literally everyone and their grandmother uses "i" for counter variables
2016-05-21 13:13:11	naf	lots of people think one letter variables only belong as the index used in loops

2016-05-21 13:16:56	Arch-TK	it's perfectly reasonable for a program which is going to be ran once and doesn't require cryptographicly strong random numbers (not that rand() provides those even if seeded well)
2016-05-21 13:17:01	twkm	yeah, rand is super strong otherwise ... shesh.

2016-05-21 13:18:32	jack_rabbit	You know, we could just wait to hear what wraith has to say instead of generating mountains of speculative bullshit.
2016-05-21 13:18:35	learningpapa	Wraith, to answer your initial question, why isn't the array populating with values, it's because you never actually assign values to the array.  You have a variable called counter which is repeatedly written over, and you never put the value that you are trying to save into the array
2016-05-21 13:18:44	 *	Arch-TK prepares a new esolang spec
2016-05-21 13:18:46	vistar1	http://codepad.org/Qqycnpv3 I already asked in ##php. They told that is error in ncurses extension.
2016-05-21 13:19:06	Arch-TK	vistar1: and this is ##c not ##old_crusty_libraries

2016-05-21 13:19:16	Arch-TK	so next, maybe ask ##ncurses ?
2016-05-21 13:19:16	naf	anyways, jack_rabbit, if what you want to do is produce an array of random values, there is surely a more succinct and complete way to go about it rather than what you're doing. you never set the random values in your array or in randVal at any point
2016-05-21 13:19:18	twkm	jack_rabbit: didn't we?  i'll leave it to you, though leaving naf's shit w/o a counter doesn't seem wise.

2016-05-21 13:20:10	jack_rabbit	And naf's shit doesn't merit a response.
2016-05-21 13:20:13	Arch-TK	naf: right, there's an issue in the code, but it doesn't have anything to do with srand (since that part seems fine) and nothing to do with rand() since it is never called

2016-05-21 13:23:20	twkm	my guess is that you pass garbage to mvwaddstr.  which thing is garbage would require debugging, of the php code that invokes it most likely, but feel free to submit a bug report to the php developers (the people that wrote the interface).
2016-05-21 13:23:30	Arch-TK	naf: if you were making a minesweeper game

2016-05-21 13:23:54	Arch-TK	would you use chacha or /dev/urandom or /dev/random, or maybe another algorithm?

2016-05-21 13:24:46	Arch-TK	naf: because it seems to conflict with the style found in the rest of the code

2016-05-21 13:24:58	Arch-TK	which once again is something which hinders readability

2016-05-21 13:26:19	CaZe	nadder: You don't actually have anything further to contribute than what has already been said, so you start talking about largely unrelated things.
